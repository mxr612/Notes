question: 2\. How is the child primarily depicted in Jean Piaget’s theory of development?
---

- [ ] As a social being heavily reliant on cultural tools
    > This describes Vygotsky's view of the child.
- [x] As a "little scientist" constructing knowledge for themselves
    > Piaget's theory is constructivist and depicts children as "little scientists" who are intrinsically motivated to learn and construct knowledge for themselves.
- [ ] As a passive recipient of environmental stimuli
    > Piaget viewed children as active learners ("constructing knowledge"), not passive recipients.
- [ ] As a blank slate entirely shaped by parental instruction
    > While the environment matters, Piaget emphasized the child's active role in constructing understanding rather than just receiving instruction.

question: 5\. When an infant adjusts their theory of the world because their current knowledge is contradicted by evidence (e.g., inanimate things coming closer when pulled), which process is occurring?
---

- [ ] Assimilation
    > Assimilation involves fitting new info into existing structures, not adjusting the structure itself.
- [ ] Centration
    > Centration is a limitation in pre-operational thinking, not a process of continuity.

question: 6\. Which of the following is NOT a central property of Piaget’s stage theory?
---

- [ ] Qualitative change
    > Qualitative change is a central property; children think in qualitatively different ways in different stages.
- [x] Variable sequence
    > Piaget's theory posits an 'Invariant sequence', meaning everyone goes through the same stages in the same order without skipping.
- [ ] Broad applicability
    > Broad applicability is a property; the type of thinking in a stage applies across contexts.

question: 9\. In the A-not-B task, what error do infants typically make until about 12 months of age?
---

- [ ] They refuse to reach for the object at all.
    > Infants do reach, but they reach to the wrong location.
- [x] They reach to where the object was found before, rather than where it was last hidden.
    > The A-not-B error is the tendency to reach to location A (where it was found before) instead of location B (where it was newly hidden).
- [ ] They reach for the object correctly but drop it immediately.
    > This does not describe the specific A-not-B perseverative error.
- [ ] They look at the correct location but reach to a third neutral location.
    > The error is specifically reaching back to the previously successful location (A).

  10\. Deferred imitation, the repetition of other people's behaviour a substantial time after it occurred, is a sign that the child has formed:
---

- [ ] Reflexive responses
    > Reflexes are innate and present from birth, not the result of deferred imitation.
- [ ] Concrete operations
    > Concrete operations develop much later (7-12 years).
- [x] Enduring mental representations
    > Deferred imitation is the first sign that infants are forming enduring mental representations towards the end of the sensorimotor stage.
- [ ] Egocentric speech
    > Egocentric speech is associated with the pre-operational stage and language use, not necessarily the act of deferred imitation itself.

question: 11\. Which stage is characterized by the acquisition of symbolic representation but limited by egocentrism and centration?
---

- [x] Pre-operational stage
    > The pre-operational stage (2-7 years) features symbolic representation, egocentrism, and conservation errors like centration.

question: 12\. The "Three-Mountains Task" is used to demonstrate which limitation of pre-operational thinking?
---

- [ ] Lack of object permanence
    > This is a sensorimotor limitation.
- [x] Egocentrism
    > The task shows that children perceive the world solely from their own viewpoint and struggle to take the spatial perspective of others.
- [ ] Inability to conserve number
    > This is tested with spreading out rows of objects, not the mountains task.
- [ ] Lack of symbolic representation
    > Pre-operational children actually *have* symbolic representation; the task tests perspective-taking.

type: single
question: 13\. Why do pre-operational children typically fail conservation tasks (e.g., liquid quantity)?
---

- [ ] They cannot see the objects clearly.
    > The issue is cognitive, not perceptual acuity.
- [ ] They lack the motor skills to pour the liquid back.
    > The task is a reasoning task, not a motor skills task.
- [ ] They are not interested in the task.
    > Failure is due to cognitive constraints, not motivation.
- [x] They focus on one perceptually salient aspect (centration) and ignore others.
    > Centration leads them to focus on one dimension (e.g., height of liquid) while ignoring another (e.g., width of glass).

---

- [ ] They systematically test one variable at a time.
    > This is the correct strategy used by formal operational adolescents.
- [x] They perform unsystematic experiments and draw incorrect conclusions.
    > Children below 12 usually fail to isolate variables, performing unsystematically.
- [ ] They refuse to touch the pendulum.
    > There is no evidence they refuse the task; they just approach it illogically.
- [ ] They solve it immediately without experimentation.

question: 17\. Which of the following is a recognized critique of Piaget’s theory?
---

- [ ] It overstates the contribution of the social world.
    > The critique is the opposite: it *understates* the contribution of the social world.
- [ ] It portrays children’s thinking as less consistent than it actually is.
    > The critique is that the stage model depicts thinking as *more* consistent than it actually is.
- [ ] It claims infants are more competent than they actually are.
    > The critique is that infants are *more* competent than Piaget recognized (he underestimated them).
- [x] It is vague about the cognitive mechanisms that produce growth.
    > A major weakness is that the theory is vague about the specific cognitive processes/mechanisms that give rise to thinking and growth.

question: 19\. Vygotsky distinguished between "lower mental functions" (innate/biological) and "higher mental functions". How do higher mental functions develop?
---

- [ ] Through biological maturation alone
    > Higher functions are not purely biological; they require social context.
- [ ] Through independent experimentation
    > This is a Piagetian concept.
- [x] Through cultural mediation and social interactions
    > Higher mental functions are consciously controlled transformations developed through cultural mediation (transmission of knowledge).
- [ ] Through the suppression of private speech

question: 21\. Vygotsky’s emphasis on children as social learners is evident in his perspective on the relation between _____.
---

- [ ] language and emotion
    > While emotion is important, the specific key relation highlighted in the theory comparison is language and thought.
- [x] language and thought
    > Vygotsky viewed private speech and language as the foundation for higher cognitive processes, meaning language and thought are integrally related.
- [ ] thought and emotion
    > This is not the primary distinction used to highlight his social learner perspective in the lecture.

question: 22\. According to Vygotsky, what is the function of "private speech" in children aged 4-6?
---

- [ ] It is a sign of cognitive immaturity and egocentrism.
    > This was Piaget's view, not Vygotsky's.
- [ ] It is intended to communicate directly with peers.
    > Private speech is self-directed, not primarily for communication with others.
- [ ] It disappears completely as soon as the child learns to read.
    > It evolves into silent inner speech (thought), it doesn't just disappear upon reading.
- [x] It helps guide behavior and serves as a foundation for higher cognitive processes.
    > Vygotsky viewed private speech as self-regulation that helps guide behavior, especially during difficult tasks.

  23\. Research on counting systems (e.g., English vs. Chinese) and brick-counting tasks (Miura et al., 1994) supports Vygotsky’s idea that:
---

- [x] The content children learn and their thinking are shaped by cultural products.
    > Differences in language structure (cultural tools) influence how children represent and manipulate numbers.
- [ ] Mathematical ability is purely biological and universal.
    > The differences found suggest cultural influence, not purely biological universality.
- [ ] Children in all cultures develop spatial abilities at the exact same rate.
    > The notes mention spatial abilities are influenced by cultural practices (e.g., safety restrictions), so they are not the same.
- [ ] Language has no impact on cognitive development.

question: 30\. Why is it beneficial to have multiple theories of development rather than just one?
---

- [ ] Because one theory is always completely wrong.
    > Theories usually provide different useful perspectives, not just "wrong" vs "right".
- [ ] Because development is purely biological and needs no explanation.
    > Development is complex and varied (cognitive, social, etc.), requiring explanation.
- [ ] Because researchers cannot agree on a single definition of "child".
    > The issue is the complexity of the process, not the definition of the subject.
- [x] Because development is a complex process, and different theories allow a broader appreciation of different capabilities.
    > No single theory accounts for all of the complex and varied process of development; multiple theories provide a broader appreciation.
