question: 1. If a researcher wishes to investigate how a group of children’s language skills improve between 18 to 24 months of age, which research design would give this researcher the best outcome?
---

- [ ] Cross-sectional
    > Cross-sectional designs compare children of different ages at the same time. While quicker, this would not track the individual improvement of the *same* children over time as well as a longitudinal study.
- [x] Longitudinal
    > Longitudinal designs study the same participants twice or more over a long period of time. This is the best design to see how specific skills (like language) improve within the same individuals from 18 to 24 months.
- [ ] Observational
    > Observational is a method of data collection, not necessarily a design for examining development over time (which is the distinction between cross-sectional and longitudinal).
- [ ] Correlational
    > Correlational describes the statistical relationship between variables, not the design regarding time and age groups.

question: 2. Some of the earliest recorded and most influential ideas about children’s development came from __________.
---

- [x] Plato and Aristotle
    > As stated in the lecture notes under "Historical and Philosophical Understanding," the classic Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle had influential ideas about children and kindled early nature vs. nurture debates.
- [ ] Freud and Jung
    > While influential in psychology, they are 19th/20th-century figures, not the "earliest recorded" regarding the philosophical roots discussed in this lecture (4th Century BCE).
- [ ] Skinner and Pavlov
    > These are associated with behaviorism and conditioning in the 20th century.
- [ ] Erickson and Vygotsky
    > These are developmental theorists from the 20th century.

question: 3. A mother consistently refuses to cuddle a child who has frequent tantrums and the occurrence of tantrums subsequently decreases. The mother has just used a mild form of:
---

- [ ] Negative reinforcement
    > Negative reinforcement strengthens (increases) a behavior by removing a negative stimulus. Here, the behavior (tantrums) decreased, so it cannot be reinforcement.
- [x] Punishment
    > In instrumental conditioning, punishment is defined as conditioning that weakens behavior (decreases the likelihood it will be repeated). By withholding the cuddle (a positive experience), the mother penalizes the behavior, causing it to decrease.
- [ ] Classical conditioning
    > Classical conditioning involves associating an involuntary reflex with a stimulus, not voluntary behaviors like tantrums and their consequences.
- [ ] Habituation
    > Habituation is a decrease in responsiveness to a repeated stimulus (e.g., getting bored of a picture), not a behavioral modification based on consequences.

question: 4. Which philosopher viewed the child as a "tabula rasa" (blank slate) and advocated for instilling discipline before freedom?
---

- [ ] Plato
    > Plato emphasized self-control and discipline but believed children were born with innate knowledge (nativist), not a blank slate.
- [ ] Aristotle
    > Aristotle believed knowledge comes from experience (empiricist) but was concerned with fitting child-rearing to the individual child's needs rather than the "tabula rasa" discipline approach specifically associated with Locke.
- [x] John Locke
    > The lecture notes state that the English philosopher John Locke saw the child as a tabula rasa (blank slate) and advocated first instilling discipline, then gradually increasing freedom.
- [ ] Jean-Jacques Rousseau
    > Rousseau argued for maximum freedom from the beginning and believed parents should let nature act for a long time.

question: 5. Which of the following is considered a "nativist" view regarding child development?
---

- [x] Children are born with innate knowledge.
    > Plato is described as a nativist in the lecture because he believed children are born with innate knowledge.
- [ ] Children are a blank slate at birth.
    > This is the empiricist view (associated with Aristotle and Locke).
- [ ] Knowledge comes exclusively from experience.
    > This is the definition of the empiricist perspective.
- [ ] Development is purely the result of social conditioning.

question: 6. Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s philosophy on child-rearing can best be summarized as:
---

- [ ] Strict discipline followed by gradual freedom.
    > This was John Locke's view.
- [ ] Fitting child-rearing to the specific needs of the individual.
    > This was Aristotle's view.
- [x] Giving the child maximum freedom from the beginning.
    > Rousseau argued that parents and society should give the child maximum freedom from the start ("Respect childhood, leave nature to act...").
- [ ] Formal education should begin as early as possible.
    > Rousseau advocated leaving "nature to act for a long time" before intervening.

question: 7. Which of the following is a primary strength of Naturalistic Observation?
---

- [ ] It allows for easy identification of causal relationships.
    > Naturalistic observation makes it hard to identify causal relationships because there are too many uncontrolled variables.
- [x] It has good ecological validity.
    > The lecture notes highlight that naturalistic observation is similar to "real-life," giving it good ecological validity.
- [ ] It is efficient for studying rare behaviors.
    > It is "painstaking to administer" because many behaviors occur only occasionally, making it a poor choice for rare behaviors.
- [ ] It provides the highest level of experimental control.
    > Naturalistic observation lacks experimental control; experiments provide control.

question: 8. Which research method allows for the direct testing of relationships between variables and offers relatively easy experimental control?
---

- [ ] Naturalistic Observation
    > Lacks control and causality.

    > Difficult to generate causal arguments and generalize.
- [x] Experiments
    > The lecture notes state that experiments can directly test relationships between variables and experimental control is relatively easy.
- [ ] Cross-sectional designs
    > This is a design based on time/age, not the method of data gathering itself, and does not inherently guarantee causal testing if not experimental.

question: 9. What is a specific limitation of the "Interview" method in developmental research?
---

- [ ] It cannot focus on the individual.
    > Interviews actually allow full focus on the individual's behavioral pattern.
- [ ] It is impossible to ask follow-up questions.
    > A strength of interviews is that follow-up questions can clarify responses.
- [x] It can be difficult to generalize beyond the individual case.
    > The lecture notes list "difficult to generalise beyond the individual case" as a limitation of interviews.
- [ ] It is considered unethical for young children.
    > Interviews are a standard method; ethical issues usually revolve around consent and harm, not the method itself.

    > This is a cross-sectional design.
- [ ] Studying the same children repeatedly over several years.
    > This is a longitudinal design.
- [x] Intensively studying children over a short period while a developmental change is occurring.
    > The micro-genetic approach involves intense observation of children thought to be on the verge of a developmental change to reveal the process of that change.
- [ ] Observing children in their natural home environment without interference.

- [ ] They are uninformative about the stability of individual differences.
    > Longitudinal designs are specifically good for indicating stability of individual differences.
- [ ] They do not reveal patterns of change.
    > They are designed to reveal individual patterns of change.
- [x] Repeatedly testing children can threaten the external validity of the study.
    > The notes list "Repeatedly testing children can threaten external validity of study" (practice effects) and participant attrition as disadvantages.
- [ ] They do not allow for the study of the same participants over time.

question: 13. Evidence that learning begins prenatally includes the finding that:
---

- [x] Newborns prefer smells and tastes familiar from the womb.
    > The lecture notes state newborns prefer smells, tastes, and sound patterns familiar because of prenatal exposure.
- [ ] Newborns can solve simple puzzles immediately after birth.
    > This requires motor and cognitive skills not present at birth.
- [ ] Newborns have fully developed vision at birth.
    > Vision is poorly developed at birth.

question: 14. In the context of infant learning, a decrease in responsiveness to repeated stimulation is called:
---

- [ ] Sensitization
    > Sensitization is an increase in response, the opposite of habituation.
- [ ] Differentiation
    > Differentiation is extracting stable elements from the environment (perceptual learning).
- [x] Habituation
    > Habituation is defined as a decrease in responsiveness to repeated stimulation, revealing that learning/memory has occurred.
- [ ] Classical Conditioning
    > This involves pairing a neutral stimulus with a reflexive one, not just a decrease in response to repetition.

question: 15. The speed with which an infant habituates is believed to reflect:
---

- [ ] The infant's emotional stability.
    > Habituation is linked to cognitive processing, not emotional stability.
- [x] The efficiency of the infant's information processing.
    > The notes state: "The speed with which an infant habituates is believed to reflect the general efficiency of the infant's processing of information."
- [ ] The quality of the infant's eyesight.
    > While vision is required for visual habituation, the *speed* is correlated with general cognitive ability/processing efficiency.
- [ ] The infant's attachment style.

question: 16. When an infant's interest is renewed after a new stimulus is presented following a period of habituation, this is known as:
---

- [ ] Extinction
    > Extinction is the weakening of a conditioned response.
- [ ] Affordance
    > Affordance refers to possibilities for action.
- [x] Dishabituation
    > The lecture notes describe dishabituation as when the infant's response (e.g., sucking rate or looking) increases upon the presentation of a novel stimulus.

    > There was no pairing of UCS and CS to elicit a reflex.
- [ ] Instrumental conditioning
    > There were no rewards or punishments involved.

- [ ] Observational Learning
    > The infant did not watch someone else kick first; they learned through their own action.
- [x] Instrumental Conditioning

question: 25. Research by Campbell et al. (1995) suggests that infants of depressed mothers may smile less because:
---

- [ ] They have genetically inherited the depression.
    > The lecture focuses on the learning mechanism (contingency), not genetics.
- [ ] They are habituated to the mother's face.
    > It is not about boredom, but about the lack of reaction.
- [x] They have learned there is no contingency relation between their smiling and being rewarded.
    > The lecture explains this as "Extinction": the infants learn they have no control/their smiling is not rewarded by the preoccupied parent.
- [ ] They are incapable of perceiving the mother's emotions.

- [x] Young infants (newborns) likely cannot imitate.
    > The lecture notes state Oostenbroek et al. suggest young infants cannot imitate, challenging earlier reports.
- [ ] Imitation does not develop until age 3.
