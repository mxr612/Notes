question: 1\. According to Piaget’s theory of moral judgment, a child who is in the "Heteronomous morality" stage would most likely consider which of the following children to be the naughtiest?
---

- [ ] A child who intentionally steals one cookie while their mother is not looking.
    > This reasoning aligns with Autonomous morality, where intentions are considered over consequences.
- [ ] A child who refuses to eat a cookie because they are not hungry.
    > This is a personal choice and does not reflect a moral transgression in this context.
- [x] A child who accidentally drops a whole jar of cookies and breaks them all while trying to help.
    > Piaget (1932) concluded that children in the Heteronomous stage (pre-operational, <7 years) focus on the consequences of an action (i.e., the outcome), not the intent. Thus, breaking a whole jar (larger consequence) is viewed as naughtier than stealing one cookie, even if accidental.
- [ ] A child who asks for a cookie before taking one.
    > This behaviour follows rules and is not considered naughty in either stage.

question: 2\. At approximately what age did Piaget suggest children transition from Heteronomous morality to Autonomous morality?
---

- [ ] 3 years old
    > This is typically the age associated with early differentiation of domains, but firmly within the pre-operational/heteronomous stage.
- [ ] 5 years old
    > This is still within the pre-operational stage associated with Heteronomous morality.
- [x] 7 years old
    > Children firmly in the concrete operational stage or beyond (approx. 7 years) transition to Autonomous morality, where they no longer blindly accept rules and begin to consider intentions.
- [ ] 11 years old
    > This age is associated with the formal operational stage, well after the transition to Autonomous morality usually begins.

question: 3\. Which of the following is a key characteristic of Piaget’s "Autonomous morality" stage?
---

- [ ] Rules are regarded as fixed and unchangeable things ("things in themselves").
    > This is a characteristic of Heteronomous morality.
- [ ] Moral judgments are governed strictly by parents' expectations.
    > This reliance on external authority is characteristic of Heteronomous morality.
- [x] The individual considers others' intentions when evaluating behaviour (outcome-to-intent shift).
    > In the Autonomous morality stage, children possess the ability to take others' perspectives (Theory of Mind) and consider intentions rather than just outcomes.
- [ ] The focus is primarily on the magnitude of the consequences (e.g., how many cups were broken).
    > Focusing on consequences over intent is the defining feature of Heteronomous morality.

question: >-
  4\. Modern research has critiqued Piaget’s theory by demonstrating that younger children can understand intentions if:
---

- [ ] The consequences are very severe.
    > Severity of consequences tends to reinforce the outcome focus in young children rather than intent.
- [x] The moral scenarios are presented in ways that make the individual's intentions more obvious.
    > Research (e.g., Grueneich, 1982) shows that when intentions are made obvious, pre-operational children are more likely to correctly identify the morally dubious act, suggesting they have the capacity earlier than Piaget thought.
- [ ] They are explicitly told the rules beforehand.
    > While rules are important, the critique focuses on the *capacity* to judge intent, which is improved by scenario design, not just rule-telling.
- [ ] They have high IQ scores.
    > While IQ is associated with moral judgment, the specific critique regarding Piaget's staging involves the methodology of the scenarios used.

  5\. In Kohlberg’s theory, "Pre-conventional moral reasoning" is primarily characterised by:
---

- [ ] A focus on upholding laws and contributing to society.
    > This characterises the Conventional level (Stage 4).
- [ ] A commitment to universal ethical principles.
    > This characterises the Post-conventional level (Stage 6).
- [x] A self-centred focus on maximising rewards and minimising punishment.
    > Level 1 (Pre-conventional) reasoning is self-centred, focusing on obedience to avoid punishment (Stage 1) or instrumental exchange (Stage 2).
- [ ] A desire to maintain good relationships and be seen as a "good" person.
    > This characterises the Conventional level (Stage 3).

question: 6\. A child who says, "I will let you play with my toy if you share your sweets with me," is demonstrating which stage of Kohlberg’s moral development?
---

- [ ] Stage 1: Obedience to authority
    > Stage 1 focuses on avoiding punishment, not exchange.
- [x] Stage 2: Instrumental and exchange orientation
    > Stage 2 focuses on the child's best interests or involves equal exchange between people (e.g., "you hurt me, so I hurt you" or "you help me, I help you").
- [ ] Stage 3: Mutual interpersonal expectations
    > Stage 3 focuses on social approval and being a "good boy/girl," not specific instrumental exchange.

question: 7\. Which stage of Kohlberg’s theory is associated with the "Good boy/Good girl" orientation, where being socially acceptable and showing concern for others is paramount?
---

- [ ] Stage 2
    > Stage 2 is instrumental and self-interested.
- [x] Stage 3
    > Stage 3 (Mutual interpersonal expectations, relationships, and interpersonal conformity) is focused on what is socially acceptable and being a "good" person in the eyes of others.
- [ ] Stage 4
    > Stage 4 shifts focus to the wider social system, laws, and duties.

question: 8\. An individual who reasons that "stealing is wrong because if everyone stole, society would collapse" is likely at which Kohlberg stage?
---

- [ ] Stage 1: Obedience to authority
    > This stage focuses on avoiding personal punishment, not societal stability.
- [ ] Stage 3: Interpersonal conformity
    > This stage focuses on immediate relationships and approval, not the abstract concept of societal order.
- [x] Stage 4: Social system and conscience orientation
    > Stage 4 involves fulfilling one's duties, upholding laws, and contributing to the social group or society to maintain the social system.
- [ ] Stage 6: Universal ethical principles
    > Stage 6 reasoning is based on abstract ethical principles that may supersede laws/order, rather than maintaining the system for its own sake.

  10\. Research on cultural differences in moral judgment (e.g., Miller et al., 1990) found that compared to children in the United States, children in India were more likely to:
---

- [ ] View helping others as a personal choice.
    > US children were more likely to view it as a personal choice.
- [x] View helping others as a moral obligation.
    > Children in India are more likely to say that helping others is a moral issue rather than a personal choice.
- [ ] Distinguish less between moral and social conventional issues.
    > The notes state it is likely people in *all* cultures differentiate between these domains; the difference is in the categorization of specific behaviours.
- [ ] Ignore the intentions of the actor completely.
    > While some cultures focus more on consequences, this specific finding relates to the classification of helping behaviour.

  11\. In "WEIRD" societies (e.g., USA), moral judgments tend to focus on intentions. In contrast, in small-scale "opacity of mind" cultures (e.g., Fiji), judgments often focus more on:
---

- [ ] The age of the individual.
    > This is not the primary distinction highlighted in the research.
- [ ] The gender of the individual.
    > This is not the primary distinction highlighted in the research.
- [x] The consequences of a person's actions.
    > Research (McNamara et al., 2019) suggests that in "opacity of mind" cultures, individuals focus more on the consequences (outcome) when making moral judgments.
- [ ] The religious context of the action.

question: 12\. Which of the following parental behaviours is most effective in fostering the development of a conscience and the adoption of moral values in children?
---

- [ ] Harsh discipline to ensure compliance.
    > Harsh discipline is less effective than rational explanation for internalisation.
- [x] Rational explanations rather than harsh discipline.
    > Children typically adopt their parents' moral values if parents use rational explanations and the children are securely attached.
- [ ] Allowing the child to make all their own rules.
    > This is permissive and does not necessarily foster the internalisation of moral standards.
- [ ] Ignoring minor transgressions to build self-esteem.
    > Conscience is built through internalising standards, which requires guidance/feedback, not ignoring behaviour.

question: 13\. What is the key difference between empathy and sympathy?
---

- [ ] Sympathy is an emotional reaction, while empathy is purely cognitive.
    > Both involve emotional components.
- [x] Empathy is feeling the same emotion as another; sympathy is feeling concern for another.
    > Empathy is an emotional reaction similar to the other person's state; Sympathy is a feeling of concern *for* the other person, often resulting from empathy.
- [ ] Sympathy appears in infancy, while empathy develops in adolescence.
    > Infants show signs of responding to distress (precursors to empathy/sympathy) much earlier than adolescence.
- [ ] Empathy leads to antisocial behaviour, while sympathy leads to prosocial behaviour.
    > Both are roots of prosocial behaviour; empathy does not inherently lead to antisocial behaviour.

question: 15\. Which of the following statements about the genetic influence on prosocial behaviour is true?
---

- [ ] Genetics plays no role in prosocial behaviour.
    > Evidence suggests a genetic component.
- [ ] Non-identical twins are more similar in prosocial behaviour than identical twins.
    > The opposite is true; identical twins are more similar.
- [x] Identical twins are more similar in their prosocial behaviour than non-identical twins.
    > This suggests a genetic factor, potentially arising indirectly from differences in temperament.
- [ ] Genetic factors are the single strongest predictor, engaging environmental factors.

  18\. As children develop language skills, physical aggression tends to decrease and be replaced by:
---

- [ ] Prosocial behaviour only.
    > While prosocial behaviour may increase, the specific replacement for physical aggression in conflict is often verbal aggression.
- [x] Verbal aggression.
    > The development of language skills sees an increase in verbal aggression (e.g., teasing/name-calling) as physical aggression declines.
- [ ] Relational aggression only.
    > Relational aggression is a specific type; verbal aggression is the broader category cited in this developmental shift.
- [ ] Reactive aggression.

    > This is instrumental physical aggression.
- [ ] Yelling at others to express anger.
    > This is verbal aggression (hostile).
- [x] Harming others' peer relationships, such as by excluding them from a group.
    > Relational aggression is defined by harming relationships or social status (Crick et al., 1997).

---

- [ ] Anticipate positive social consequences for aggression.
    > This is characteristic of *proactive* aggression.
- [x] Perceive other people's motives as hostile.
    > Reactive aggression is emotionally driven and antagonistic; these children often have a "hostile attribution bias."
- [ ] Use aggression unemotionally to fulfill a desire.
    > This is characteristic of *proactive* aggression.
- [ ] Be identified as popular by their peers.
    > Reactive aggression is often associated with rejection or controversy, not necessarily popularity in the same way proactive strategies might be.

question: 21\. Which of the following is true regarding the stability of aggressive behaviour?
---

- [ ] Aggression at age 8 does not predict aggression in adulthood.
    > Research shows strong continuity.
- [ ] Late-onset (adolescent) conduct problems are more likely to persist into adulthood than early-onset problems.
    > Early-onset problems are associated with higher risk of persistence.
- [x] Children identified as aggressive at age 8 have higher self-reported aggression and more criminal convictions at age 30.
    > Eron et al. (1987) found significant stability in aggressive behaviour from childhood to adulthood.

question: 24\. Which criticism is frequently levelled at Kohlberg's theory of moral development?
---

- [ ] It focuses too much on behaviour and not enough on reasoning.
    > Kohlberg focused almost exclusively on reasoning (cognitive), which is sometimes a critique in itself, but the opposite of this statement.
- [ ] It overestimates the moral reasoning of young children.
    > Piaget is often critiqued for *underestimating* children; Kohlberg is critiqued for other reasons.
- [x] It did not sufficiently differentiate between moral issues and social convention issues.
    > Critics (e.g., Nucci & Gingo, 2011) argue Kohlberg conflated these domains.
- [ ] It places too much emphasis on the role of parents.

- [ ] Fear of unfamiliar people
    > While stranger anxiety can begin around this time, the specific reaction to *loss of control* (frustration) is the classic "anger" milestone often cited for this age in this curriculum.
- [ ] Smiling at strangers
    > By 7 months, indiscriminate smiling (social smile) has typically been replaced by selective smiling for caregivers; strangers may elicit wariness.

- [ ] Neither loud noises nor the visual cliff
    > Fear of the visual cliff (danger of falling) persists.
- [ ] Loud noises and the visual cliff
    > While possible, developmental trends often emphasise the decline of early reflexive fears (like simple loud noises) or separation anxiety, while safety fears (heights) remain. However, "The visual cliff only" is the stronger distractor if implying developmental shift.
- [x] The visual cliff only
    > Fear of heights (avoidance of the visual cliff) is a learned safety response that emerges with crawling and persists. Early reflexive fears or specific infant anxieties often decline or transform by toddlerhood.
