question: 1\. Which mechanism does NOT contribute to genetic diversity among people?
---

- [ ] Crossing over
    > This contributes to diversity by swapping sections of DNA between chromosome pairs.
- [ ] Mutations
    > This contributes to diversity by introducing changes in sections of DNA.
- [x] Different nutritional levels in women during pregnancy
    > While nutrition affects development and gene expression (epigenetics), it is not a mechanism of genetic diversity (changes in the DNA sequence itself) like random assortment, crossing over, or mutation.
- [ ] Random assortment
    > This contributes to diversity by determining which member of a chromosome pair goes into a gamete by chance.

question: 2\. In studies of rats, pups that receive more licking and grooming from their mothers show lower stress reactivity as adults. This is because maternal care affects the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in the pups’ brains. What does this finding demonstrate?
---

- [x] Environmental experiences can alter gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, leading to long-term changes in behaviour.
    > The lecture describes how high licking/grooming decreases methylation, allowing the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor, resulting in lower anxiety. This is a classic example of epigenetics.
- [ ] Only genes related to stress are affected by environmental factors.
    > Epigenetic changes can affect various genes, not just those related to stress.
- [ ] Maternal behaviour permanently changes the DNA sequence of the glucocorticoid receptor gene.
    > Epigenetics changes the *expression* of the gene (e.g., via methylation), not the DNA sequence itself.
- [ ] The pups’ stress responses are determined entirely by their genotype and cannot be influenced by experience.
    > The study specifically shows that experience (maternal care) alters the phenotype (stress response).

question: 3\. A person carries a Bb genotype for eye colour, where B = brown and b = blue. Which option correctly describes their genotype and phenotype?
---

- [ ] Genotype heterozygous and phenotype blue eyes
    > Heterozygous is correct, but since B (brown) is dominant, the phenotype would be brown.
- [ ] Genotype homozygous dominant and phenotype brown eyes
    > Homozygous dominant would be BB.
- [ ] Genotype homozygous recessive and phenotype blue eyes
    > Homozygous recessive would be bb.
- [x] Genotype heterozygous and phenotype brown eyes
    > The individual has two different alleles (heterozygous), and the dominant allele (B) is expressed in the phenotype.

question: 4\. Two biological parents both have brown hair, but each carries one recessive allele for blonde hair. This means both parents have the genotype Bb, where B = brown (dominant) and b = blonde (recessive). According to Mendelian inheritance patterns, if these two parents had 4 biological children together (all singleton births), on average how many would you expect to have blonde hair?
---

- [ ] 4 out of 4
    > Incorrect. Only the bb combination results in blonde hair.
- [ ] 2 out of 4
    > Incorrect. Half the children are expected to be heterozygous (Bb), resulting in brown hair.
- [x] 1 out of 4
    > In a Bb x Bb cross, the probability of a child being homozygous recessive (bb) is 25% (1 in 4).
- [ ] 3 out of 4
    > Incorrect. 3 out of 4 are expected to have brown hair (BB or Bb).

question: 5\. Which is considered the ideal behaviour genetics design?
---

- [x] An adoptive twin study
    > Comparing identical twins raised apart separates genetic and environmental influences most cleanly, making it a very powerful design.
- [ ] A monozygotic twin study
    > A standard MZ twin study relies on the equal environments assumption and doesn't fully separate shared environment from genetics without a comparison group (like DZ twins) or separation (adoption).
- [ ] The equal environments assumption
    > This is an assumption underlying twin studies, not a research design itself.
- [ ] A dizygotic twin study
    > DZ twins share only 50% of genes; studying them alone without comparison to MZ twins or adopted siblings is less informative for separating nature and nurture.

    > The genome is the complete set of genetic material, not the single basic unit.
- [ ] Chromosome
    > A chromosome is a package of DNA containing many genes.
- [x] Gene
    > A gene is defined in the lecture as the basic unit of heredity, providing instructions for making proteins or controlling other genes.
- [ ] Phenotype
    > Phenotype is the observable expression of genetic material, not the unit of heredity itself.

question: 7\. Approximately what percentage of human DNA is made up of genes?
---

- [x] 1%
    > The lecture notes state that genes only take up 1% of the DNA, with the rest playing a role in regulation.
- [ ] 10%
    > Incorrect. The percentage is much lower.
- [ ] 50%
    > Incorrect. This figure often appears in heritability of intelligence discussions, not DNA composition.
- [ ] 99%
    > Incorrect. While humans share much DNA, the coding genes themselves constitute a small fraction of the total DNA.

question: 8\. Which term describes the complete set of genetic material in an organism?

    > The genome is defined as the complete set of genetic material in an organism.

    > Incorrect.
- [x] 23 pairs

- [ ] The mitochondrial DNA
    > This is inherited from the mother but does not determine sex.
- [ ] The random assortment of autosomes
    > Autosomes are non-sex chromosomes.

question: 14\. Why are X-linked recessive disorders more common in males (XY) than in females (XX)?
---

- [ ] The Y chromosome carries dominant alleles that cause these disorders.
    > The disorders are usually recessive and located on the X chromosome.
- [ ] Males have more chromosomes than females.
    > Both have 46 chromosomes.
- [x] The Y chromosome is smaller and lacks matching alleles to override recessive alleles on the X chromosome.
    > The Y chromosome has fewer genes (approx 200) compared to the X (approx 1500), so a recessive allele on the X has no dominant counterpart on the Y to mask it.
- [ ] Males have higher mutation rates in their DNA.
    > The prevalence of these disorders is due to the inheritance pattern, not mutation rates.
