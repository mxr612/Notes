question: 1. What are the main events during the zygotic (germinal) period of prenatal development?
---

- [ ] Formation of major organ systems
    > This occurs during the embryonic period (3-8 weeks), where organogenesis takes place.
- [ ] Growth and refinement of body structures
    > This describes the fetal period (9 weeks to birth), characterized by rapid growth and behavioral development.
- [x] Rapid cell division and implantation in the uterine wall
    > The germinal period lasts from conception to implantation (roughly 0-2 weeks). The key processes are rapid cell division (mitosis) where cell numbers double twice a day, and the implantation of the zygote into the uterine wall.
- [ ] Development of the placenta and umbilical cord
    > While the support system begins to form after implantation, the defining characteristic of the germinal stage itself is the journey from fertilization to implantation and the initial cell division.

question: 2. The impact of teratogens during prenatal development can vary in their effects depending on all of the following EXCEPT:
---

- [x] Paternal age at conception
    > The lecture notes list specific factors influencing the severity of teratogenic effects: Timing (sensitive periods), Dose-response relation (amount/duration), and Individual differences (genetic susceptibility). Paternal age is not listed as a factor influencing the severity of a *teratogen's* effect on the fetus in this context.
- [ ] Length of exposure
    > The dose-response relation indicates that the effect increases with the extent (duration and amount) of exposure.
- [ ] Dose–response relationship
    > The notes explicitly state that the amount and duration of exposure determine the severity of the effect.
- [ ] Timing
    > Timing is crucial because organs are most vulnerable during their specific sensitive periods (e.g., thalidomide affects limbs primarily between the 4th and 6th week).

question: 3. A child was diagnosed with a congenital condition at birth known as syndactyly, where her toes were conjoined on both feet. How would you best explain this condition?
---

- [ ] The child likely developed tumors later in fetal development.
    > Tumors are unregulated cell growth, whereas syndactyly is a failure of separation.
- [ ] The zygote did not experience mitosis.
    > If mitosis (cell division) did not occur, development would not proceed past the single-cell stage.
- [ ] During fetal growth, the fetus developed a defect in the neural tube.
    > Neural tube defects result in conditions like spina bifida or anencephaly, affecting the brain and spinal cord, not the separation of digits.
- [x] The child likely did not undergo the correct sequence of apoptosis during prenatal development
    > Apoptosis is the selective, programmed death of certain cells. In prenatal development, apoptosis is necessary to remove the cells between the fingers and toes; a failure in this process results in syndactyly (webbed or conjoined digits).

question: 4. Spontaneous electrical activity in the developing brain helps shape early neural connections even before birth. This process reflects:
---

- [ ] Neural differentiation
    > Differentiation refers to stem cells transforming into specialized cell types, not the shaping of connections via activity.
- [ ] Cell migration
    > Migration is the movement of cells to their appropriate locations, occurring before the refinement of connections.
- [ ] Neural tube formation
    > This is an early structural event (U-shaped groove closing) to form the brain and spinal cord, distinct from synaptic tuning.
- [x] Hebbian learning
    > The notes describe Hebbian learning in the context of prenatal development as spontaneous electrical activity (e.g., from the retina) enabling networks to form visual pathways even before birth. "Cells that fire together, wire together."

question: 5. Researchers presented fetuses with different patterns of light projected through the uterine wall. They found that fetuses turned their heads more often toward lights arranged in a face-like configuration than toward inverted patterns. What does this suggest?
---

- [ ] Fetuses prefer inverted face-like patterns.
    > The study showed the opposite: they engaged more with upright face-like configurations.
- [ ] Fetuses are attracted to any bright light, regardless of its shape or arrangement.
    > If this were true, there would be no significant difference between the upright and inverted conditions, yet a difference was found.
- [ ] Fetuses cannot yet differentiate between different visual patterns.
    > The differential response (head turns) proves they can discriminate between the patterns.
- [x] Fetuses can detect and prefer face-like patterns.
    > Ideally citing Reid et al. (2017), the lecture concludes that postnatal experience is not necessary for the emergence of a preference for face-like stimuli; fetuses actively orient towards them in the womb.

question: 6. Dena is 30 weeks pregnant and has volunteered for a study. She reads a book aloud every night for two weeks. Then, a friend reads the same book. Which finding would demonstrate that the fetus has dishabituated after becoming habituated to Dena’s voice?
---

- [ ] The fetus’s responses became less reactive by the end of the first two weeks.
    > This describes habituation (getting used to the stimulus), not dishabituation.
- [ ] The fetus showed a preference for the friend’s voice.
    > While true that they might distinguish it, "preference" isn't the definition of dishabituation; a physiological response recovery is required.
- [x] The fetus’s heart rate increased when the friend began reading the book.
    > Habituation is a decrease in response to a repeated stimulus (Dena's voice). Dishabituation is the recovery of the response when a new, distinct stimulus (the friend's voice) is presented, indicating the fetus discriminates between the two.
- [ ] The fetus showed no physiological changes during the study.
    > This would indicate a lack of sensation, attention, or learning, rather than habituation/dishabituation.

question: 7. Which biological process is responsible for the production of gametes (egg and sperm) containing half the genetic material of normal cells?
---

- [x] Meiosis
    > Gametes are reproductive cells produced through meiosis. This process ensures they contain half the genetic material (23 chromosomes) compared to normal body cells, so fertilization restores the full set.
- [ ] Mitosis
    > Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells with a full set of chromosomes, used for growth and tissue repair.
- [ ] Apoptosis
    > Apoptosis is programmed cell death, used to remove unnecessary cells (e.g., between fingers).
- [ ] Synaptogenesis
    > Synaptogenesis is the formation of synapses between neurons in the nervous system.

question: 8. During prenatal development, stem cells transform into roughly 350 different types of specialized cells. This process is known as:
---

- [ ] Cell migration
    > Cell migration involves the movement of cells from their point of origin to other locations, not their transformation.
- [x] Cell differentiation
    > Cell differentiation is explicitly defined in the notes as the transformation of stem cells into roughly 350 different types of specialized cells.
- [ ] Cell proliferation
    > Cell proliferation refers to the rapid increase in the number of cells via division (mitosis).
- [ ] Apoptosis
    > Apoptosis is the selective death of cells.

- [x] Implantation to the 8th week
    > The lecture slides classify the Embryonic period as lasting from implantation (around the 2nd week) until the 8th week.
- [ ] Conception to the 8th week
    > This overlaps the Germinal and Embryonic periods.

question: 10. Which statement regarding the placenta is correct?
---

- [ ] It is a perfect barrier that blocks all toxins and viruses.
    > The notes explicitly state it is "Not a perfect barrier" and acts as a semi-permeable membrane.
- [x] It allows for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste between the mother and fetus.
    > The placenta's main function is the exchange of materials (in: oxygen, nutrients, antibodies; out: CO2, waste) between the bloodstream of the fetus and the mother.
- [ ] It is the tube containing blood vessels connecting the fetus to the uterine wall.
    > This describes the umbilical cord.
- [ ] It is formed solely from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst.
    > The inner cell mass becomes the embryo; the *rest* of the cells develop into the support system (placenta/amniotic sac).

question: 11. The neural tube, which eventually differentiates into the brain and spinal cord, is formed from:
---

- [x] A U-shaped groove in the top layer of differentiated cells
    > The lecture describes the neural tube formation as a U-shaped groove that becomes a tube, which then differentiates into the brain and spinal cord.
- [ ] The umbilical cord extending into the embryo
    > The umbilical cord is part of the support system, not the origin of the central nervous system.
- [ ] The proliferation of stem cells in the limbs
    > Limb development is separate from the formation of the central nervous system.
- [ ] The amniotic sac compressing the embryo
    > The amniotic sac provides a protective buffer, it does not form the neural tube.

question: 13. Which theory of development suggests that genes, brain structure, brain function, and experience all interact bidirectionally?
---

- [ ] Blueprint analogy
    > This theory suggests genes specify each connection (Genes -> Brain).
- [x] Probabilistic development
    > This theory proposes bidirectional interactions: Genes <-> Brain Structure <-> Brain Function <-> Experience.
- [ ] Predetermined development
    > This theory suggests a linear flow: Genes -> Brain Structure -> Brain Function -> Experience.
- [ ] Maturational theory
    > This generally refers to development unfolding according to a specific biological plan, similar to predetermined.

question: 15. The drug Thalidomide, used in the 1960s, is a classic example of how timing affects teratogenic impact. What specific deformity did it cause when taken between the 4th and 6th week?
---

- [x] Major limb deformities
    > Thalidomide was used for morning sickness and caused major limb deformities (arms/legs) when taken during the sensitive period for limb development (4-6 weeks).
- [ ] Blindness
    > While sensory issues can occur, the hallmark defect of Thalidomide is limb reduction/deformity.
- [ ] Deafness
    > This is often associated with Rubella.
- [ ] Cognitive impairment
    > This is the primary outcome of alcohol exposure (FASD), whereas Thalidomide's primary visible effect was physical structure.

- [ ] The fetus sleeping more due to drug exposure.
    > This refers to immediate behavioural state, not the teratogenic concept of a sleeper effect.
- [x] An effect that only becomes apparent later in the child's life.
    > The notes define the sleeper effect as an "apparent effect only later," giving the example of DES (hormone) causing cancer in offspring years later.
- [ ] A drug that causes the mother to sleep, harming the baby.
    > This is not the definition of the sleeper effect.
- [ ] The immediate impact of sedatives on fetal heart rate.

- [ ] Prenatal EEG
    > EEG measures electrical activity (functional).
- [x] Prenatal Ultrasound
    > The notes describe prenatal ultrasound as using structural differences in tissue properties to create static maps.
- [ ] fMRI
    > While MRI is mentioned, the specific description of "different types of tissue... have different physical properties – used to create STATIC maps" is linked to Ultrasound in the slides (though MRI also does structure, Ultrasound is the primary context for standard static mapping in the notes provided).
