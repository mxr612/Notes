question: 1\. By showing them two paddles simultaneously (one with black and white stripes of differing width, and the other a gray paddle) and checking which one the infant stares at for longer, which visual skill of infants can be measured?
---

- [x] Visual acuity
    > Reason: Visual acuity (the sharpness and clarity of vision) is estimated by comparing how long a baby looks at a striped pattern versus a plain gray square. If the infant looks longer at the stripes, it indicates they can distinguish the pattern from the gray field.
- [ ] Gaze following
    > Reason: Gaze following refers to looking where another person is looking, not the discrimination of fine patterns.
- [ ] Depth perception
    > Reason: Depth perception involves perceiving distance and three-dimensionality, often measured using cues like optical expansion or binocular disparity, not acuity paddles.
- [ ] Stereopsis
    > Reason: Stereopsis is the process of combining neural signals from two eyes to perceive depth, which emerges around 4 months, usually tested with stereograms, not acuity paddles.

question: 2\. Which of the below is an example of object segregation?
---

- [ ] Perceiving objects as being of constant size, shape and colour in spite of physical differences in the retinal image of the object
    > Reason: This describes perceptual constancy, not object segregation.
- [x] Perceiving the coffee table and the vase on top of it as two independent objects
    > Reason: Object segregation is the perception of boundaries between objects. Identifying a vase as separate from the table it sits on is a classic example of this ability.
- [ ] Understanding that if an object occludes increasingly more of the background, the object is approaching
    > Reason: This describes optical expansion, a depth perception cue.
- [ ] Integrating the separate elements of a visual display into a coherent pattern even when there are no physical edges or shapes
    > Reason: This refers to pattern perception or subjective contours (e.g., seeing an illusory square).

question: 3\. Which of the below is NOT correct about infants' sense of taste and smell?
---

- [ ] Infants are sensitive to taste and smell before birth
    > Reason: This is true; sensitivity to taste and smell develops prenatally.
- [ ] Newborn infants prefer the smell of their own amniotic fluid relative to another baby's
    > Reason: This is true; research (Marlier et al., 1998) shows newborns prefer the smell of their "own" amniotic fluid.
- [x] Newborn babies respond similarly to their own mother's scent and a different female's scent
    > Reason: This is incorrect. By two weeks of age, babies can differentiate their mother's scent from others (MacFarlane, 1975), and even 2-day-olds orient longer to their mother's scent (Marin et al., 2015).
- [ ] Newborn babies can move towards their mother's odour if they were outfitted with a device that helps them move
    > Reason: This is true; using a "Crawliskate," infants crawled farther when smelling their mother's odor (Hym et al., 2021).

type: single
question: 4\. Which term describes the process of organizing and interpreting sensory information about objects, events, and spatial layout?
---

- [ ] Sensation
    > Reason: Sensation refers to the processing of basic information by sensory receptors, not the interpretation of that information.
- [x] Perception
    > Reason: Perception is defined as the process of organizing and interpreting sensory information about the objects, events, and spatial layout of the surrounding world.
- [ ] Habituation
    > Reason: Habituation is a research method involving repeated presentation of a stimulus, not the definition of interpreting sensory input.
- [ ] Acuity
    > Reason: Acuity refers to the sharpness of vision, which is a specific aspect of sensation/vision, not the general process of interpretation.

question: 5\. A researcher repeatedly shows an infant a picture of a cat until the infant looks away and loses interest. The researcher then shows a picture of a dog, and the infant's looking time increases. What is this research technique called?
---

- [ ] Preferential-looking
    > Reason: Preferential-looking involves showing two stimuli simultaneously to see if the infant prefers one over the other.
- [x] Habituation
    > Reason: Habituation involves repeatedly presenting a stimulus until the response declines. If the response increases (dishabituation) to a new stimulus, it implies the infant discriminates between them.
- [ ] Operant conditioning
    > Reason: Operant conditioning involves rewarding specific behaviors (like sucking patterns), not passive looking times based on boredom/novelty.
- [ ] Stereopsis
    > Reason: Stereopsis is a visual process related to depth perception, not a research methodology.
```

type: single
question: 6\. Why do very young infants (up to 2 months) prefer to look at patterns of high visual contrast, such as a black and white checkerboard?
---

- [ ] They have a developed preference for artistic complexity
    > Reason: Infants prefer high contrast due to physiological limitations, not aesthetic appreciation.
- [ ] Their binocular disparity is fully developed
    > Reason: Binocular disparity relates to depth perception (stereopsis), which emerges around 4 months, not contrast sensitivity.
- [x] They have poor contrast sensitivity due to immature cone cells
    > Reason: Young infants have poor contrast sensitivity because the cones in the fovea differ from adults in size, shape, and spacing, making it hard to see low-contrast patterns.
- [ ] They can only see the colour red
    > Reason: While colour vision is limited, the preference for high contrast is driven by the immaturity of the cones and general contrast sensitivity, not specifically just seeing red.

question: 7\. According to Maurer & Salapatek (1976), how does visual scanning behavior differ between a 1-month-old and a 2-month-old when viewing a shape?
---

- [ ] 1-month-olds scan the interior; 2-month-olds scan the perimeter
    > Reason: This is the reverse of the developmental finding.
- [ ] Both age groups focus solely on the eyes
    > Reason: This does not accurately describe the general scanning of shapes; specific face scanning develops differently.
- [x] 1-month-olds scan the perimeter; 2-month-olds scan both the perimeter and the interior
    > Reason: 1-month-olds tend to fixate on the outer edges (perimeters) of shapes, while 2-month-olds begin to scan the internal details (interiors) as well.
- [ ] 1-month-olds cannot scan at all; 2-month-olds scan the perimeter
    > Reason: Infants scan the environment right away, even if tracking is not smooth.
```

type: single
question: 8\. Which of the following best explains why newborns show a preference for face-like stimuli?
---

- [ ] They have an innate knowledge of what a human face looks like
    > Reason: The bias is general, not necessarily a specific innate template of a human face.
- [x] They have a general bias toward configurations with more elements in the upper half
    > Reason: From birth, infants are drawn to faces because of a general bias toward configurations that are "top-heavy" (more elements in the upper half than the lower half).
- [ ] They are imprinted on their mother’s face immediately at birth
    > Reason: While they recognize their mother quickly (12 hours), the general preference for face-like patterns is due to the top-heavy bias, not immediate imprinting.
- [ ] They prefer low-contrast patterns found in faces
    > Reason: Infants actually prefer high contrast; faces are preferred due to configuration, not low contrast.

question: 9\. Research on "perceptual narrowing" suggests that while 6-month-olds can distinguish between different monkey faces, 9-month-olds cannot. What does this indicate?
---

- [ ] Visual acuity degrades between 6 and 9 months
    > Reason: Visual acuity improves, it does not degrade.
- [ ] 9-month-olds lose interest in animals
    > Reason: The result is about discrimination ability, not social interest.
- [x] Face processing becomes specialized for the species seen most often (humans)
    > Reason: This is an example of perceptual narrowing/tuning, where discrimination abilities become specialized to the stimuli (human faces) encountered in the environment, losing the ability to discriminate unfamiliar types (monkey faces).
- [ ] 9-month-olds have developed prosopagnosia
    > Reason: This refers to a specific deficit (face blindness), whereas the finding describes a normal developmental process of specialization.

question: 10\. In the study by Pons et al. (2015) regarding "talking faces," where did 8-month-old bilingual infants primarily fixate when listening to both native and non-native languages?
---

- [ ] Primarily on the eyes
    > Reason: This was characteristic of younger (4-month-old) infants.
- [x] Primarily on the mouth
    > Reason: Bilingual 8-month-olds (and 12-month-olds) fixated primarily on the mouth for both native and non-native languages to utilize audiovisual cues for dual-language learning.
- [ ] On the mouth only for the non-native language
    > Reason: This pattern was observed in monolingual 12-month-olds, not bilinguals.
- [ ] On the hairline
    > Reason: This is not a primary area of fixation for speech processing.

question: 11\. When presented with a visual display suggesting a "subjective contour" (an illusory square that does not actually exist), at what age do infants perceive the overall pattern and detect the square?
---

- [ ] 1 month
    > Reason: Very young infants tend to scan perimeters and do not integrate complex patterns yet.
- [ ] 2 months
    > Reason: While 2-month-olds can integrate elements, the specific detection of the illusory square is cited as occurring later in the notes.
- [x] 7 months
    > Reason: Bertenthal et al. (1980) found that 7-month-olds see the overall pattern and detect the illusory square.
- [ ] 12 months
    > Reason: The ability emerges earlier, around 7 months.

type: single
question: 12\. How was size constancy demonstrated in newborns in the study by Slater et al. (1990)?
---

- [x] Newborns looked longer at a larger cube placed further away, indicating they perceived it as a different size despite having the same retinal image size as a closer, smaller cube.
    > Reason: The study showed that newborns possess size constancy. They were habituated to a cube, then shown a larger cube further away (same retinal size) vs. the original cube. They looked longer at the larger cube, perceiving it as novel/different in size.
- [ ] Newborns reached for the larger object consistently.
    > Reason: Newborns cannot reach reliably; this method tests preferential looking, not reaching.
- [ ] Newborns could not distinguish between two cubes of different sizes.
    > Reason: The results showed they *could* distinguish them, demonstrating constancy.
- [ ] Newborns preferred the smaller cube regardless of distance.
    > Reason: The study measured discrimination based on habituation/novelty, not a simple size preference.

type: single
question: 13\. In Kellman and Spelke's (1983) experiment with a rod moving behind a block, what factor was crucial for 4-month-old infants to perceive the two rod segments as a single continuous object?
---

- [ ] Color
    > Reason: While color aids vision, the specific cue tested for segregation was movement.
- [ ] Texture
    > Reason: Texture is a surface property, but movement was the critical factor for inferring continuity behind the occluder.
- [x] Movement
    > Reason: Infants perceived the two segments as a single rod only when they were moving together (common motion). If stationary, they did not perceive them as connected.
- [ ] Binocular disparity
    > Reason: The experiment highlighted the role of independent motion in object segregation.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 14\. What behavior indicates that infants as young as 1 month perceive depth via optical expansion?
---

- [ ] They reach for the object.
    > Reason: 1-month-olds do not have accurate reaching skills.
- [x] They blink defensively at an object appearing to head towards them.
    > Reason: Náñez (1988) found that 1-month-olds blink defensively when an object expands optically, indicating they perceive it as approaching.
- [ ] They turn their head away.
    > Reason: The specific reflex noted in the literature for optical expansion is blinking.
- [ ] They cry immediately.
    > Reason: Blinking is the specific perceptual response measured.

type: single
question: 15\. Stereopsis, the process by which the visual cortex combines differing neural signals from the two eyes, emerges suddenly around which age?
---

- [ ] 1 month
    > Reason: This is too early; optical expansion is present, but stereopsis is not.
- [ ] 2 months
    > Reason: Still too early for the sudden emergence of stereopsis.
- [x] 4 months
    > Reason: Held et al. (1980) found that stereopsis emerges suddenly around 4 months of age.
- [ ] 8 months
    > Reason: Stereopsis appears earlier (4 months); by 8 months vision is similar to adults.

question: 16\. In a study using a trapezoidal window, a 7-month-old infant wearing an eye patch reached for the longer side of the window. What does this indicate?
---

- [ ] The infant has poor depth perception.
    > Reason: It indicates the presence of depth perception using specific cues.
- [ ] The infant relies on binocular disparity.
    > Reason: The eye patch removes binocular cues, forcing the use of monocular cues.
- [x] The infant uses monocular depth cues like relative size.
    > Reason: By reaching for the longer side (which appears closer due to relative size/linear perspective in the trapezoid illusion), the infant demonstrates sensitivity to monocular/pictorial depth cues.
- [ ] The infant is confused by the window shape.
    > Reason: The reaching behavior is a systematic response to depth cues, not confusion.
```

question: >-
  17\. Research by DeLoache et al. (1998) on pictorial representations found that until about 19 months of age, infants:
---

- [ ] Cannot recognize pictures at all.
    > Reason: Even newborns can recognize 2D versions of 3D objects.
- [x] Attempt to treat pictures as though they were real objects.
    > Reason: Infants and toddlers manually explore pictures (e.g., trying to pick up a picture of an object) because they do not yet fully understand the symbolic nature of pictures.
- [ ] Prefer black and white pictures only.
    > Reason: This relates to early contrast sensitivity, not the symbolic understanding of pictures at 19 months.
- [ ] Understand that pictures are symbols.
    > Reason: This understanding is what they lack; they treat them as real objects.

question: >-
  18\. The study by Eimas (1985) using the sucking rate procedure demonstrated that 2-month-old infants could:
---

- [ ] Sing a melody.
    > Reason: 2-month-olds cannot sing.
- [x] Discriminate between phonemes like /pa/ and /ba/.
    > Reason: The study showed that after habituating to /pa/, infants dishabituated (sucking rate increased) when presented with /ba/, showing they could hear the difference.
- [ ] Understand the meaning of words.
    > Reason: Discriminating sounds (phonemes) is different from semantic understanding (meaning).
- [ ] Localize sound in space.
    > Reason: While they can localize sound, the Eimas study specifically tested phoneme discrimination.

type: single
question: 19\. Which of the following is true regarding infants' perception of music?
---

- [ ] Infants prefer dissonant music over consonant music.
    > Reason: Research shows the opposite; infants (even 2-day-olds) prefer consonant music.
- [ ] Infants do not respond to rhythm until 12 months.
    > Reason: Infants respond to rhythm and temporal organization much earlier.
- [x] Infants prefer infant-directed songs over adult-directed songs.
    > Reason: Studies across societies show a strong preference for the subdued, soothing nature of infant-directed singing.
- [ ] Infants cannot detect changes in melody.
    > Reason: Infants are sensitive to melody and recognize the same tune even if the key changes.

question: 20\. A study by Zhao & Kuhl (2016) assigned 9-month-olds to a musical intervention group. What was the outcome?
---

- [ ] The infants became professional musicians.
    > Reason: The study measured processing abilities, not professional status.
- [ ] There was no difference between the intervention and control groups.
    > Reason: Significant differences were found.
- [x] Infants in the music group were better at processing patterns in both music and speech.
    > Reason: The study supports the idea that musical experience aids the development of auditory processing patterns relevant to both music and language.
- [ ] Infants in the music group lost the ability to distinguish speech sounds.
    > Reason: The intervention improved their processing, it did not impair it.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 21\. Which statement best reflects the plasticity of the auditory brain in relation to music?
---

- [ ] Musical ability is entirely genetic and cannot be changed.
    > Reason: Research on plasticity and interventions (Zhao & Kuhl) suggests experience plays a major role.
- [x] Adult musicians' brains are shaped by the instruments they play.
    > Reason: Lecture notes state that musicians' brains show plasticity shaped by their instrument, and they process pitch/rhythm better than non-musicians.
- [ ] Non-musicians process pitch better than musicians.
    > Reason: Musicians are better at processing pitch and rhythm.
- [ ] Auditory processing is fully mature at birth.
    > Reason: Hearing does not approach adult levels until age 5 or 6.

question: 22\. What characterizes the development of visual acuity in infants?
---

- [ ] It is fully developed at birth (20/20 vision).
    > Reason: Newborns have about 20/120 vision; it is not fully developed.
- [x] It reaches adult levels around 6 years of age.
    > Reason: While it improves significantly by 8 months, full adult acuity is reached by 6 years of age.
- [ ] It declines after 8 months.
    > Reason: Vision continues to mature or stays stable; it does not decline.
- [ ] It is tested using operant conditioning with food rewards.
    > Reason: It is typically tested using preferential looking (paddles), not food rewards.

question: 23\. In the domain of intermodal perception, what did Streri and Spelke (1988) find when infants held rings (rigid vs. flexible) under a cloth?
---

- [ ] Infants could not distinguish the rings by touch.
    > Reason: They could distinguish them habituated to them.
- [ ] Infants looked longer at the rings that matched what they had felt.
    > Reason: In habituation paradigms, looking longer usually indicates novelty.
- [x] Infants looked longer at the rings that were different from those they had explored with their hands.
    > Reason: This indicates they recognized the visual match as "familiar" (and thus looked at it less) and the non-matching one as "novel" (looking at it longer), demonstrating a link between tactile and visual perception.
- [ ] Infants refused to hold the rings.
    > Reason: The infants explored the rings until habituation.

type: single
question: 24\. Which of the following statements about smooth tracking of moving objects is correct?
---

- [ ] Newborns can track fast-moving objects smoothly immediately after birth.
    > Reason: Newborn tracking is not smooth.
- [x] Infants cannot track even slowly moving objects smoothly until 2 to 3 months of age.
    > Reason: Aslin (1981) showed that smooth tracking develops around 2-3 months.
- [ ] Tracking ability disappears at 4 months.
    > Reason: Tracking improves, it does not disappear.
- [ ] Tracking relies solely on auditory cues.
    > Reason: Tracking described here is a visual motor skill.

question: 25\. What did William James (1890) famously but incorrectly predict about the infant's sensory experience?
---

- [ ] It is a "blank slate."
    > Reason: This is Locke's view. James described the sensory experience specifically.
- [x] It is a "blooming, buzzing confusion."
    > Reason: James believed the baby feels all sensory input as one chaotic confusion, which modern research has proven wrong (infants are organized).
- [ ] It is sharper than an adult's.
    > Reason: James predicted confusion, not superior acuity.
- [ ] It is completely silent.
    > Reason: He referred to a chaotic mix of all senses (eyes, ears, etc.).

question: 26\. Regarding colour vision, how does an infant's ability compare to an adult's?
---

- [ ] Infants are completely colorblind until 1 year of age.
    > Reason: Infants have limited color vision at birth but it develops rapidly.
- [ ] Infants have better color discrimination than adults at birth.
    > Reason: It is limited at birth due to immature cones.
- [x] By 2-3 months, infants' colour vision is similar to that of adults.
    > Reason: Kellman & Arterberry (2006) note that while limited at birth, it becomes similar to adults by 2-3 months.
- [ ] Infants can distinguish pastel colours better than bright vivid colours.
    > Reason: Infants discriminate bright, high-contrast colors better than faint, pastel ones.

type: single
question: 27\. Which sense is considered the most advanced in the newborn?
---

- [ ] Vision
    > Reason: Vision is relatively poor (acuity 20/120) and improves over months.
- [x] Hearing
    > Reason: Hearing is described as the most advanced of the newborn senses, though still developing until age 5-6.
- [ ] Taste
    > Reason: While present, hearing is noted as the most advanced in the lecture context.
- [ ] Stereopsis
    > Reason: Stereopsis (depth perception) is not present at birth.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 28\. What is "operant conditioning" used for in the context of studying infant perception?
---

- [ ] To measure visual acuity using paddles.
    > Reason: That is preferential looking.
- [ ] To create illusory contours.
    > Reason: This is a stimulus feature, not a method.
- [x] To test preferences by rewarding a specific behavior (e.g., sucking pattern) with a stimulus.
    > Reason: Researchers reward infants (e.g., with a sound) for a specific sucking pattern to ascertain which reward/stimulus the child prefers.
- [ ] To track eye movements automatically.
    > Reason: This is eye-tracking, distinct from conditioning.

question: >-
  29\. Walker-Andrews (1997) found that by 5 months of age, infants demonstrate intermodal perception by:
---

- [ ] Reaching for objects they see.
    > Reason: This is visuo-motor, but the specific finding is about emotion.
- [x] Associating facial expressions with emotion in voices.
    > Reason: Infants matched the emotional tone of a voice to the corresponding facial expression, linking auditory and visual information.
- [ ] Preferring sweet tastes over sour ones.
    > Reason: This is taste perception, not intermodal.
- [ ] Distinguishing their mother's face from a stranger's.
    > Reason: This is visual recognition, not necessarily intermodal (unless linking voice). The specific 5-month finding is about emotion matching.
```

type: single
question: 30\. How do infants learn about their environment through touch during the first few months of life?
---

- [x] Oral exploration is the dominant method.
    > Reason: For the first few months, infants mouth and suck on objects to discover their texture and taste.
- [ ] Manual exploration (hands) is dominant immediately at birth.
    > Reason: Advanced hand and arm movements for exploration become dominant from 4 months onwards.
- [ ] They rely solely on their feet.
    > Reason: While they feel with skin, oral exploration is dominant early on.
- [ ] They do not use touch until 6 months.
    > Reason: Touch is active from birth (and before).
