question: 1\. According to Piaget's classic theory, at what age does the understanding of object permanence typically develop?
---

- [ ] At birth
    > Piaget argued it develops later.
- [ ] Around 3 to 4 months
    > This is the age suggested by newer Violation of Expectancy research, not Piaget.
- [x] Around 8 months
    > Piaget claimed that understanding of object permanence does not develop until around 8 months. Until then, an infant will not search for an object that has been removed from sight.
- [ ] Around 12 months
    > This is later than Piaget's claim for the initial onset of object permanence.
```

question: 2\. In the classic A-not-B task, what specific error defines the "A-not-B error"?
---

- [ ] The infant fails to find the object in location A after watching it being hidden there.
    > This would be a failure of simple object search, not the A-not-B error.
- [x] The infant searches in location A for the object, even after watching it being hidden in location B.
    > In the A-not-B task, after successfully finding an object in location A several times, the infant watches the object being hidden in a new location (B). Infants who make the error still search in location A rather than location B.
- [ ] The infant searches in location B immediately, ignoring location A entirely.
    > This would indicate success in the task, not the error.
- [ ] The infant loses interest and does not search for the object at all.
    > This is a lack of motivation or attention, not the specific perseverative error described by Piaget.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 3\. Which of the following is a factor that makes the A-not-B error *less* likely to occur?
---

- [ ] A longer delay between hiding and searching.
    > Longer delays generally make the error more likely due to memory constraints.
- [ ] A younger age of the child.
    > Younger infants are more likely to make the error compared to older infants who have better inhibitory control.
- [ ] A higher number of times the object was hidden in location A previously.
    > More repetitions at A reinforce the habit, making the error more likely.
- [x] Distinctive visual differences between the hiding locations.
    > While not explicitly listed as a primary factor in the summary list (age, delay, number of locations), research indicates that factors making the correct location more distinct or reducing memory load help reduce the error. The lecture notes emphasize age, delay, and number of hiding locations/times hidden as key factors affecting the error rate.

question: 4\. In Bower et al.'s (1971) "Anticipatory Looking" study, what behavior suggested 5-month-olds understood the object continued to exist behind the screen?
---

- [ ] They reached for the screen to pull it away.
    > This refers to a reaching task, not the anticipatory looking task.
- [ ] They looked back at the starting point of the object's trajectory.
    > This would indicate they did not expect the object to continue.
- [x] Their eyes tracked the movement towards the screen and continued along the trajectory to the other side.
    > Infants tracked movement towards the screen and did not look at the other side before the object emerged. When the object stopped behind the screen, their eyes continued to move along the trajectory, anticipating its re-emergence.
- [ ] They cried when the object disappeared.
    > Distress is not the specific measure of cognitive anticipation used in this study.
```

type: single
question: 5\. What was the significance of the "Reaching in the Dark" study by Clifton et al. (1991)?
---

- [ ] It proved that infants are afraid of the dark.
    > The study was designed to test object permanence, not fear.
- [x] It showed that 6.5-month-olds could use mental representations to guide reaching for objects they could hear but not see.
    > Researchers found that infants reached with one hand for a small object and two hands for a bigger one in the dark, based on sound. This suggests they had a mental representation of the previously seen objects to guide motor action.
- [ ] It demonstrated that infants only reach for objects that are glowing or illuminated.
    > The study specifically used darkness to ensure the reach was guided by memory/sound, not vision.
- [ ] It showed that infants fail to reach for objects if they cannot see their own hands.
    > The infants successfully reached for the objects using infrared video to capture the action.
```

type: single
question: 6\. The "Violation of Expectancy" (VoE) procedure relies on which logical assumption about infant behavior?
---

- [ ] Infants will smile more at events they find probable.
    > Looking time, not affect (smiling), is the primary measure.
- [ ] Infants will look longer at an event that violates their expectations (is "impossible") compared to a possible event.
    > The premise is that infants look longer at "impossible" events because they are surprised, implying they possess the physical knowledge being violated (e.g., object permanence).
- [ ] Infants will look away quickly from events that are confusing or impossible.
    > The opposite is true; they tend to stare longer at the violation.
- [x] Infants will reach for objects that violate the laws of physics.
    > VoE measures visual attention (looking time), not reaching behavior.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 7\. In Baillargeon's "Rabbit/Carrot" study, what result suggested that 5-month-old infants possessed object permanence?
---

- [ ] They looked longer when the short rabbit disappeared behind the short screen.
    > This is a possible event and should not elicit surprise.
- [ ] They looked equally long at all events.
    > This would suggest a failure to distinguish between possible and impossible events.
- [x] They looked longer when the tall rabbit failed to appear in the window of the short screen.
    > This was the "impossible" event. The infants understood the rabbit continued to exist and should have been visible in the window as it passed behind the screen.
- [ ] They looked longer when the tall rabbit appeared on the other side of the screen.
    > The re-emergence is expected; the failure to appear in the window was the violation.
```

type: single
question: 8\. Why might infants succeed in Violation of Expectancy tasks but fail the A-not-B task regarding object permanence?
---

- [ ] VoE tasks are simply more entertaining than A-not-B tasks.
    > The difference lies in cognitive demands, not entertainment value.
- [ ] A-not-B tasks require better visual acuity than VoE tasks.
    > Both require vision, but the processing demands differ.
- [x] A-not-B tasks require inhibitory control and action planning, which depend on the immature prefrontal cortex.
    > Possible explanations for the discrepancy include memory limitations, problems with inhibitory control associated with immaturity of the prefrontal cortex, and competition between a representational system and a response system.
- [ ] Infants do not actually have object permanence during VoE tasks; it is a statistical anomaly.
    > The results are highly replicable and generally accepted as evidence of early representation.

question: 9\. Regarding physical knowledge of gravity, Kim & Spelke (1992) found that 7-month-olds look longer at which event?
---

- [ ] A ball rolling down a slope.
    > This is a possible/expected event under gravity.
- [x] A ball rolling up a slope unaided.
    > Infants have been shown to look longer at objects that violate expected motion trajectories, such as a ball rolling up a slope without aid, indicating surprise at the violation of gravity.
- [ ] A ball stopping at the bottom of a slope.
    > This is physically possible.
- [ ] A ball dropping straight down.
    > This is consistent with gravity.

question: 10\. How does the understanding of "support relations" develop between 3 and 12.5 months of age?
---

- [ ] It is innate and fully formed at birth.
    > Research shows a gradual refinement of this knowledge.
- [ ] It develops suddenly around 12 months when the child begins to walk.
    > It is a progressive process starting much earlier.
- [x] It is a gradually refined understanding where infants make progressively more complex judgments about what support is sufficient (e.g., contact vs. amount of contact).
    > Baillargeon (1998) showed that between 3 and 12.5 months, infants move from understanding simple contact to understanding the proportion of support required.
- [ ] Infants lose the ability to understand support relations as they age.
    > Knowledge increases, not decreases.

question: >-
  11\. In Woodward's (1998) study on social knowledge, 6-month-olds looked longer when a human arm reached for:
---

- [ ] The same object in a new location.
    > This is consistent with the goal (the object), so it is not surprising.
- [x] A new object in the old location.
    > Infants assume the action is directed toward the *object* (the goal), not the place. Reaching for a new object violates the expectation of the established goal, even if the location is the same.
- [ ] The same object in the same location.
    > This is the habituation event.
- [ ] A hidden object.
    > The study compared reaches to visible objects (Old Object/New Place vs New Object/Old Place).
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 12\. In the study by Johnson (2003) regarding a "blob" object, under what condition did infants follow the blob's gaze?
---

- [ ] When the blob was completely silent and motionless.
    > Infants treat it as an object in this case.
- [ ] When the blob had a human face painted on it.
    > The blob was faceless in the experiment.
- [x] When the blob "vocalized" and moved contingently in response to the infant.
    > Infants attribute intentions to inanimate entities if they simulate human interaction (contingency). They followed the gaze of the contingent blob but not the non-contingent one.
- [ ] When the blob moved randomly around the room.
    > Random motion does not signal social agency or intention.

question: 13\. Kuhlmeier et al. (2003) demonstrated that 12-month-olds attribute dispositional states by showing them a film of a ball, a triangle, and a square. What did the infants expect?
---

- [ ] The ball to approach the square that blocked it.
    > The square was the "hinderer," so approaching it would be unexpected.
- [ ] The ball to avoid both shapes equally.
    > This implies no attribution of helping/hindering traits.
- [x] The ball to approach the triangle that "helped" it.
    > Infants expected the ball to approach the helpful triangle while avoiding the hindering square, suggesting they attributed positive/negative dispositions to the shapes.
- [ ] The ball to stay at the bottom of the hill.
    > The test measured approach behavior towards the other shapes.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 14\. Which level of category hierarchy is usually learned first by children?
---

- [ ] Superordinate level (e.g., Living things)
    > These categories are too general and share fewer common characteristics.
- [ ] Subordinate level (e.g., Parrots)
    > These are too specific and members are hard to discriminate.
- [x] Basic level (e.g., Birds)
    > Objects at this level share many common characteristics and are relatively easy to discriminate from other categories.
- [ ] Abstract level (e.g., Concepts)
    > This is not one of the three main levels described by Rosch.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 15\. What are "child-basic categories"?
---

- [ ] Categories that are exactly the same as adult basic categories.
    > They differ slightly in generality.
- [ ] Categories formed only by infants under 6 months.
    > Mervis (1987) describes these in language-learning children.
- [x] Categories whose generality is between basic and subordinate, such as "things that roll" instead of "balls".
    > Children sometimes form these intermediate categories based on salient features or functions.
- [ ] Categories that include only imaginary objects.
    > They refer to real-world objects.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 16\. Which of these represents the most typical organization of superordinate, subordinate, and basic category levels that young children tend to form?
---

- [x] animals/beagles/dogs
    > This list contains an example of a Superordinate (animals), a Subordinate (beagles), and a Basic (dogs) category, which are the three levels of categorical hierarchies children learn.
- [ ] parents/teachers/grandparents
    > These are roles, not a standard set-subset hierarchy in this context.
- [ ] objects/plants/beagles
    > "Objects" is very general, "plants" is superordinate/basic depending on context, "beagles" is subordinate, but they do not form a single vertical hierarchy lineage.
- [ ] animals/beagles/pets
    > "Pets" is a functional category, not the standard taxonomic basic level for this hierarchy.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 17\. What is "perceptual categorization" in the context of infant development?
---

- [ ] Grouping objects based on their genetic history.
    > This is biological essentialism, not perceptual categorization.
- [x] The grouping together of objects that have similar appearances (color, size, movement).
    > A key element in infants' thinking is perceptual categorization, often based on parts of objects (e.g., legs for animals).
- [ ] Grouping objects based on their function (e.g., tools).
    > This is functional categorization, which develops slightly later/differently.
- [ ] The ability to count objects in a set.
    > This refers to numerical knowledge.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 18\. Which statement BEST demonstrates that infants form perceptual categories?
---

- [ ] Infants habituate to photos of very different-looking mammals and stay habituated (bored) when shown a picture of a fish or bird.
    > If they stay habituated, they failed to notice the category difference.
- [ ] Infants habituate to photos of very different-looking cats and stay habituated (bored) when shown a picture of a dog.
    > This would suggest they group cats and dogs together, failing to distinguish the specific category "cat".
- [ ] Three- and 4-year-olds recognize that some biological processes are independent of one's desires.
    > This relates to biological knowledge, not infant perceptual categorization.
- [x] Infants habituate to photos of very different-looking cats but dishabituate (look longer) when shown a picture of a dog.
    > Quinn & Eimas (1996) showed that even 3-4 month olds can form a category for "cat" and recognize a "dog" as being outside that category based on perceptual features.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 19\. In the study by Mandler & McDonough (1993), how did 9-11 month olds treat toy birds and airplanes?
---

- [ ] As members of the same category because they both have wings.
    > This was true for younger infants (7 months), who relied on perceptual similarity.
- [x] As members of conceptually different categories, despite looking alike.
    > By 9-11 months, infants differentiated them conceptually (animate vs. inanimate) even though they were perceptually similar.
- [ ] They were afraid of the airplanes but not the birds.
    > The study measured categorization, not fear.
- [ ] They could not distinguish them from cars.
    > The comparison was specifically between the perceptually similar birds and airplanes.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 20\. By the age of 14 months, how do children demonstrate categorization based on *function*?
---

- [ ] They sort objects by color perfectly.
    > Color is a perceptual feature.
- [x] They mime feeding a bottle to a toy rabbit but not to a toy motorcycle.
    > This shows they understand the function (feeding) applies to living things (rabbit) and not vehicles (motorcycle), termed category-appropriate action.
- [ ] They call all four-legged animals "dogs".
    > This is an overextension error in naming, not necessarily functional action.
- [ ] They can explain the difference between a car and a bus.
    > Verbal explanation is beyond this age group.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 21\. How does understanding causal relations help children learn categories (e.g., the "Wugs" and "Gillies" study)?
---

- [ ] It makes no difference; children learn by rote memorization.
    > The study showed a significant benefit to causal explanations.
- [ ] Children remember categories better if they are told *why* objects have certain features (e.g., claws to fight).
    > Hearing that "wugs" have claws to help them fight allowed children to categorize novel pictures better than children who just saw the physical features without the explanation.
- [ ] Causal explanations confuse children and lower their performance.
    > The opposite was found; it improved performance.
- [ ] Children only understand causal relations after age 10.
    > 4- and 5-year-olds demonstrated this benefit in the study.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 22\. What is "Psychological Essentialism" in the context of children's biological knowledge?
---

- [ ] The belief that psychology is the most essential science.
    > Irrelevant.
- [x] The view that living things have an essence inside them that makes them what they are.
    > This leads children to believe that inner properties (like "boy-ness" or "dog-ness") determine behavior and preferences, often ignoring environmental influence.
- [ ] The understanding that all living things must eat and breathe.
    > This is general biological knowledge, not essentialism specifically.
- [ ] The belief that non-living objects have feelings.
    > This is animism.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 23\. Poulin-Dubois (1999) found that infants are surprised when inanimate objects (like a robot) move on their own. What does this suggest?
---

- [ ] Infants are afraid of robots.
    > Surprise in this context relates to conceptual expectation, not fear.
- [ ] Infants think everything is alive.
    > If they thought everything was alive, the robot moving wouldn't be surprising.
- [x] Infants understand that self-produced motion is a distinctive characteristic of people and animals (living things).
    > Distinguishing people/animals from non-living things relies on cues like self-produced motion.
- [ ] Infants prefer robots over humans.
    > Not the finding of the study.

type: single
question: 24\. Regarding the knowledge of heredity, what do preschoolers generally believe (e.g., the Mr. and Mrs. Bull study)?
---

- [ ] Offspring will look exactly like their environment, regardless of parents.
    > They understand heredity plays a role.
- [x] Physical characteristics (like heart color) are passed from parent to offspring.
    > If told Mr. and Mrs. Bull have unusual heart colors, 3- and 4-year-olds predict the baby will too.
- [ ] Adopted children will look like their adoptive parents.
    > This would imply environmental dominance, which they tend to reject in favor of heredity for physical traits.
- [ ] Heredity only applies to humans, not animals.
    > The study used animals (Bulls) effectively.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 25\. Which statement is TRUE regarding preschoolers' understanding of healing?
---

- [ ] Preschoolers think that inanimate objects have internal processes that help them heal if they are injured.
    > They generally understand that inanimate objects cannot heal themselves.
- [x] Four-year-olds realize that a tomato plant that is scratched can heal itself but that a scratched table cannot heal itself.
    > They know that plants and animals (living things) have internal processes to heal, unlike inanimate objects.
- [ ] Preschoolers think living things can live forever.
    > They understand that death is a permanent state.
- [ ] Five-year-olds realize that a human that is scratched can heal itself but think that a scratched tomato plant cannot heal itself.
    > They extend the capacity for healing to plants as well as animals.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 26\. Which view argues that children are born with a "core concept" of number and a special mechanism for learning it?
---

- [ ] Empiricists
    > Empiricists argue knowledge arises from experience.
- [x] Nativists
    > Nativists argue that an innate understanding of concepts (including number) plays a central role in development and that the brain (e.g., intraparietal sulcus) is prepared for it.
- [ ] Constructivists
    > While Piaget (a constructivist) had theories, the specific "core concept" and "special mechanism" language is Nativist.
- [ ] Behaviorists
    > Behaviorists focus on conditioning, not innate core concepts.
```

type: single
question: 27\. What did Izard et al. (2009) find regarding newborns and "number equality"?
---

- [ ] Newborns can count to 10 verbally.
    > Newborns cannot speak.
- [ ] Newborns prefer looking at faces over numbers.
    > True generally, but not the point of the number equality study.
- [x] Newborns exhibit a nonlinguistic sense of numerical equality, matching auditory tones to visual arrays of the same number.
    > Newborns looked longer at a visual array (e.g., 4 objects) that matched the number of sounds they heard (e.g., 4 tones).
- [ ] Newborns cannot distinguish between a set of 4 objects and a set of 12 objects.
    > Evidence suggests they can distinguish large ratio differences.

type: single
question: 28\. In Wynn's "Infant Arithmetic" study (1+1), infants looked longer at which outcome?
---

- [ ] When the screen dropped to reveal 2 objects (the possible outcome).
    > This matches the expectation ($1+1=2$).
- [x] When the screen dropped to reveal 1 object (the impossible outcome).
    > Infants expected $1+1=2$. Seeing only 1 object violated this expectation, causing longer looking times.
- [ ] When the hand removed the object.
    > This was part of the setup, not the test outcome.
- [ ] When the screen stayed up.
    > The test requires the screen to drop to show the result.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 29\. What is a key argument of Empiricists regarding the development of number concepts?
---

- [ ] The Intraparietal sulcus is solely responsible for number processing from birth.
    > This is a Nativist biological argument.
- [x] Children learn about number through experiences, noting large cultural differences in understanding.
    > Empiricists emphasize the role of learning mechanisms and environmental exposure.
- [ ] Children cannot learn math until age 7.
    > Empiricists acknowledge earlier learning through experience.
- [ ] Numerical equality is a useless concept.
    > They do not claim it is useless, just learned.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 30\. Regarding the development of Conceptual Knowledge, what role do "hierarchies" play?
---

- [ ] They allow infants to physically stack objects.
    > This refers to physical stacking, not conceptual hierarchies.
- [ ] They are only used by adults, not children.
    > Children actively form them to make sense of the world.
- [x] They help people make sense of the world by dividing objects into categories related by set-subset relations.
    > Categorical hierarchies (superordinate, basic, subordinate) are a major way infants figure out how things are related.
- [ ] They prevent children from learning basic level categories.
    > Hierarchies *include* basic level categories.
