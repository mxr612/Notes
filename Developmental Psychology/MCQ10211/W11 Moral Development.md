question: 1. Which of the following statements about the development of the conscience is true according to the lecture notes?
---

- [ ] Children are born with an internal regulatory mechanism of behaviour that changes little over time
    > The notes state that the conscience develops slowly over time, rather than being fully formed at birth.
- [ ] Regular discipline involving harsh punishment is the best way to ensure a child develops an active conscience
    > The notes indicate that children typically adopt their parents' moral values if parents use rational explanations rather than harsh discipline.
- [x] The conscience of a young child primarily reflects internalised parental standards
    > The lecture notes explicitly state that "The conscience of a young child primarily reflects internalised parental standards" and acts as an internal regulatory mechanism.
- [ ] All children firmly reject parental standards by the age of 5
    > There is no evidence in the notes to support this; instead, it suggests children adopt parental values under specific conditions (rational explanations, secure attachment).
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 2. Which of the following factors are cited in the lecture as contributing to the development of prosocial behaviour?
---

- [ ] Secure attachment
    > Secure attachment is listed as a factor that helps children adopt moral values and potentially prosocial traits.
- [ ] Positive role models
    > The notes state that children are more likely to imitate the prosocial behaviour of adults with whom they have a positive relationship.
- [ ] Discipline involving reasoning
    > Discipline involving reasoning fosters voluntary prosocial behaviour, especially when it points out consequences for others.
- [x] All of the above
    > The lecture notes identify secure attachment, socialisation/modelling (positive role models), and constructive parenting (discipline involving reasoning) as factors promoting prosocial behaviour.

question: 3. Max is deciding whether or not to wear a bright red suit to a sombre funeral. According to Social Domain Theory, this is an example of which type of judgement?
---

- [ ] Moral judgement
    > Moral judgements pertain to issues of right and wrong, fairness, and justice (e.g., stealing).
- [x] Social conventional judgement
    > Social conventional judgements pertain to customs or regulations intended to secure social coordination and organisation (e.g., clothing choices for specific events).
- [ ] Personal judgement
    > Personal judgements refer to actions where individual preferences are the main consideration (e.g., what to eat for lunch).
- [ ] Legal judgement
    > This is not one of the three domains specified in Social Domain Theory.

question: 4. According to Piaget's theory of moral development, a child in the 'Heteronomous morality' stage would most likely judge which of the following scenarios as "naughtier"?
---

- [x] Accidentally breaking 10 cups while trying to help
    > Children in the heteronomous stage (pre-operational) focus on the consequences (outcome) rather than the intent. Breaking 10 cups is a larger negative outcome than breaking one.
- [ ] Intentionally breaking 1 cup out of anger
    > A heteronomous child focuses on the size of the damage (1 cup) rather than the bad intent.
- [ ] Stealing a cookie when told not to
    > While naughty, the physical damage (consequence) of breaking 10 cups often outweighs this in a heteronomous assessment.
- [ ] Refusing to share a toy
    > This implies a social interaction, but Piaget's classic examples focus on physical consequences vs. intent.
```

type: single
question: 5. Which of the following is a characteristic of Piaget's 'Autonomous morality' stage?
---

- [ ] Rules are regarded as fixed and unchangeable
    > This is a characteristic of Heteronomous morality.
- [x] Consideration of others' intentions when evaluating behaviour
    > In the Autonomous stage (concrete operational and beyond), children show an "outcome-to-intent shift" and consider motives.
- [ ] Focus primarily on the consequences of an action
    > This is a characteristic of Heteronomous morality.
- [ ] Governance by parents' expectations only
    > Autonomous children no longer blindly accept rules and possess the ability to take perspectives.

question: 6. Which critique of Piaget's theory is supported by research mentioned in the lecture (e.g., Grueneich, 1982)?
---

- [ ] Piaget overestimated the moral reasoning of young children
    > The critique is the opposite; researchers believe he underestimated them.
- [x] Pre-operational children can identify moral dubiousness if intentions are made obvious
    > Research shows that when scenarios make intentions obvious, even younger children (pre-operational) can correctly identify the naughtier action.
- [ ] Moral development has no cognitive component
    > The notes agree that moral development includes a cognitive component.
- [ ] Cross-cultural studies completely refute Piaget's ideas on motive
    > The notes say cross-cultural studies actually suggest children *do* increasingly take motives into account, supporting that aspect of Piaget's theory.

question: 7. In Kohlberg's 'Pre-conventional' level of moral reasoning, what is the primary focus of the individual?
---

- [ ] Upholding laws and contributing to society
    > This describes the Conventional level (Stage 4).
- [x] Maximising rewards and minimising punishment
    > Pre-conventional reasoning is self-centred and focused on avoidance of punishment (Stage 1) or exchange/benefits (Stage 2).
- [ ] Universal ethical principles
    > This describes the Post-conventional level (Stage 6).
- [ ] Social approval and being a "good boy/girl"
    > This describes the Conventional level (Stage 3).

question: 8. A child argues, "I will let you play with my toy if you let me play with yours." Which stage of Kohlberg's theory does this reflect?
---

- [ ] Stage 1: Obedience to authority
    > Stage 1 is motivated by avoiding punishment.
- [x] Stage 2: Instrumental and exchange orientation
    > Stage 2 focuses on the child's best interests or involves equal exchange ("you hurt me, I hurt you" or "you help me, I help you").
- [ ] Stage 3: Mutual interpersonal expectations
    > Stage 3 is about being seen as "good" and showing concern, not just transactional exchange.
- [ ] Stage 4: Social system and conscience
    > Stage 4 is about duty and law.

question: 9. An individual reasoning at Kohlberg's Stage 4 (Social system and conscience orientation) would most likely argue that:
---

- [ ] Stealing is okay if it saves a life because life is more important than property
    > This is Stage 5 or 6 (Post-conventional) reasoning.
- [ ] One should steal to look like a hero to their spouse
    > This is likely Stage 3 (seeking approval/good motives).
- [x] One must uphold the law to maintain social order and fulfill duties
    > Stage 4 focuses on fulfilling duties, upholding laws, and contributing to society/group stability.
- [ ] Stealing is wrong because you might get caught and go to prison
    > This is Stage 1 (Pre-conventional/Punishment avoidance).

question: 11. Which of the following is a noted criticism of Kohlberg's theory mentioned in the lecture?
---

- [ ] It places too much emphasis on gender differences
    > The criticism is that he *failed* to consider gender differences.
- [x] It failed to distinguish between moral issues and social conventions
    > Critics (e.g., Nucci & Gingo, 2011) argue Kohlberg did not sufficiently differentiate between truly moral issues and social conventions.
- [ ] It suggests moral development is too fluid and not stage-like enough
    > The criticism is the opposite: Kohlberg suggested discontinuous stages, but evidence suggests reasoning is less stage-like and more continuous.
- [ ] It focuses too heavily on non-Western cultures
    > The criticism is that he did not consider cross-cultural differences (bias toward WEIRD samples).

    > This would involve right/wrong or justice.
- [ ] Social conventional judgement
    > This would involve customs or social coordination (e.g., how to eat politely).
- [x] Personal judgement
    > Personal judgements refer to actions where individual preferences are the main consideration.
- [ ] Pre-conventional judgement

---

- [x] Children in India are more likely to view helping others as a moral duty than children in the USA
    > The notes state children in India are more likely to say helping others is a moral rather than personal choice compared to US children.
- [ ] Children in the USA view helping others as a strict moral obligation
    > US children are more likely to view it as a personal choice.
- [ ] There is no difference between Indian and US children regarding helping behaviour
    > The study highlights a specific cultural difference.
- [ ] Children in India view helping others as a social convention only
    > They view it as a moral choice/duty.

question: 14. In "opacity of mind" cultures (e.g., Fiji), moral judgements tend to focus more on:
---

- [ ] The individual's intentions
    > This is characteristic of WEIRD societies (e.g., USA).
- [x] The consequences of a person's actions
    > The notes state that in small-scale "opacity of mind" cultures, individuals focus more on consequences than intentions.
- [ ] Universal human rights
    > This is related to Kohlberg's Stage 6, not specifically this cultural distinction.
- [ ] Personal preferences
    > This refers to the personal domain, not the basis for moral judgement in these cultures.

    > Secure attachment is explicitly listed as a condition for adopting parental moral values (Konchanska et al., 2002).
- [ ] The parents avoid giving any explanations for rules
    > Rational explanations are required.
- [ ] The child is in the pre-operational stage

---

- [ ] It is motivated by the desire for social approval
    > This is a self-serving motive, not altruistic.
- [ ] It is motivated by the expectation of a reward
    > This is instrumental/exchange, not altruistic.
- [ ] It is motivated by conflict avoidance
    > This is a protective motive, not altruistic.

question: 17. How do the lecture notes distinguish between empathy and sympathy?
---

- [ ] Empathy is a feeling of concern; sympathy is an emotional reaction similar to another's
    > This reverses the definitions provided.
- [x] Empathy is an emotional reaction similar to another's state; sympathy is a feeling of concern for another
    > Empathy is feeling *with* the person (same state); Sympathy is feeling *for* the person (concern).
- [ ] They are synonymous and can be used interchangeably
    > The notes explicitly state they are "often mistakenly used interchangeably, but have different meanings".
- [ ] Sympathy develops before empathy
    > The notes suggest sympathy is often an outcome of empathising.

---

- [ ] They have no contribution
    > Studies show they have a contribution.
- [ ] They are the sole determinant
    > The notes say they have a "modest contribution".
- [x] They have a modest contribution, potentially through temperament
    > Identical twins are more similar than non-identical, but the contribution is modest and may act indirectly via temperament.
- [ ] They prevent environmental influences from working
    > Environmental influences like socialisation are described as a "strong influence".

---

- [ ] Anticipate positive social consequences for aggression
    > This is characteristic of *proactive* aggression.
- [x] Perceive other people's motives as hostile (Hostile Attribution Bias)
    > Reactive aggression is emotionally driven, and these children tend to perceive motives as hostile.
- [ ] Be unemotional in their aggressive acts

---

- [ ] It was used primarily by Piaget to test heteronomous morality
    > It is most associated with Kohlberg.
- [x] It assesses the reasoning behind a moral decision, not just the decision itself
    > Kohlberg's theory focuses on the *reasoning* (Why did Heinz steal?), not just whether he stole or not.
- [ ] It proves that all children naturally want to steal medicine
    > It is a hypothetical dilemma used to classify moral stages.
