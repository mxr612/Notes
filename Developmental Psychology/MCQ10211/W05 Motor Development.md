question: 1\. What do developmental researchers like Thelen (1984) suggest about why the stepping reflex disappears and later reappears as voluntary walking?
---

- [ ] The reflex fades because it serves no purpose after early infancy.
    > The stepping reflex does disappear around 2 months, but Dynamic Systems theorists argue this is not due to lack of purpose or simple fading, but rather physical constraints.
- [ ] It disappears as the brain suppresses automatic movements until walking begins.
    > This was the traditional "neurological maturity" view, which Thelen's research challenged by showing the reflex could be elicited under specific physical conditions (like in water).
- [x] The reflex is masked by changes in body weight and muscle strength before being reorganized into intentional stepping.
    > Research by Esther Thelen demonstrated that the stepping reflex disappears not because of cortical maturation, but because the infant's leg weight increases faster than their muscle strength (changing ratio of leg weight to strength). When weights were added to younger infants, they stopped stepping; when older non-stepping infants were put in water, they stepped again.
- [ ] It reappears only in cultures where infants are given daily exercise or massage.
    > While culture (e.g., Mali) can hasten motor development, the reappearance of the reflex behavior in Thelen's experiments was specifically linked to physical manipulation of weight/buoyancy, not cultural training.

question: 2\. Why does the dynamic systems approach argue that the development of skills like walking cannot be explained by brain maturation alone?
---

- [ ] Because the brain develops faster than other systems.
    > The brain is a crucial component, but the dynamic systems view specifically argues against the brain being the *sole* driver of development.
- [x] Because motor skills emerge from interactions among neural activity, body growth, motivation, and environmental feedback.
    > Current theories take a dynamic systems approach, emphasizing a confluence of many factors including neural mechanisms, increases in strength, posture control, balance, perceptual skills, motivation, and the environment. Movement depends on multiple systems working together, not just the brain.
- [ ] Because infants are genetically programmed to move in fixed stages.
    > This aligns more with the traditional maturation view (neurological maturity) rather than the dynamic systems view, which sees development as flexible and assembly-based.
- [ ] Because sensory systems develop before the motor cortex.
    > While sensory systems do develop early, the core argument of dynamic systems is the integration of multiple components (body, environment, brain) rather than just the timing of sensory vs. motor development.

question: 3\. What key finding from Adolph et al.’s (1993) study with slopes best supports the idea of the specificity of motor learning?
---

- [ ] Infants transfer knowledge about safe slopes from crawling to walking.
    > Adolph found the opposite: infants do *not* transfer learning from what they know about crawling down slopes to walking down them.
- [x] Each new posture requires infants to relearn how to perceive environmental risks.
    > Karen Adolph found that infants do not transfer learning from crawling to walking. A "seasoned crawler" may avoid a steep slope, but when they start walking, they may attempt the same slope and fall. This suggests motor learning is specific to the posture and infants must relearn affordances for each new mode of locomotion.
- [ ] Infants rely solely on visual depth cues regardless of motor experience.
    > The study showed that experience matters; specifically, experience *within* a specific motor domain (crawling vs walking) dictates how they react to the depth/slope.
- [ ] Experience in one motor domain automatically improves perceptual accuracy in all others.
    > The study illustrates the "specificity of motor learning," meaning experience in one domain (crawling) does not automatically improve judgment in a new domain (walking).

question: 4\. Why do we have a brain, according to the perspective introduced in the Motor Development lecture?
---

- [ ] Primarily to store memories and process language.
    > While the brain does these things, the lecture emphasizes that these are not the evolutionary "whole picture" regarding why the brain exists.
- [ ] To perceive the world and think abstractly.
    > Perception and thinking are functions of the brain, but the lecture highlights a more fundamental biological purpose related to interaction with the environment.
- [ ] To regulate automatic biological functions like heart rate only.
    > The brain does regulate these, but the lecture focuses on the complex interaction with the external world.
- [x] To produce adaptable and complex movement.
    > The lecture introduces the topic by asking "Why do we have a brain?" and concludes that the ultimate purpose is to produce adaptable and complex movement to interact with the world, moving beyond just perception or thinking.

question: 5\. Which of the following best describes a reflex in a newborn?
---

- [x] An innate, fixed pattern of action that occurs in response to particular stimulation.
    > Newborns demonstrate reflexes which are defined as innate, fixed patterns of action that occur in response to particular stimulation (e.g., rooting, sucking).
- [ ] A voluntary movement learned through trial and error during the first week.
    > Reflexes are innate and distinct from voluntary movements, which develop later as the cortex matures.
- [ ] A completely random movement that has no specific trigger.
    > Reflexes are not random; they are specific responses to specific stimuli (e.g., stroking the cheek triggers rooting).
- [ ] A permanent behavior that persists throughout adulthood.
    > Most newborn reflexes fade during the first few months; their long-term persistence can actually indicate neurological disorders.

question: 6\. The "Rooting" reflex is characterized by which behavior and disappears around which age?
---

- [ ] The baby sucks repeatedly when something is put in their mouth; disappears at 4 months.
    > This describes the Sucking reflex, not the Rooting reflex.
- [x] The baby turns their head and opens their mouth when their cheek is stroked; disappears around 3 weeks.
    > Rooting involves the baby turning their head and opening their mouth when the cheek is stroked. It disappears around 3 weeks when it is replaced by voluntary head turning.
- [ ] The baby throws arms out backwards and arches back; disappears around 6 months.
    > This describes the Moro reflex.
- [ ] The baby’s toes fan out and curl when the foot is stroked; disappears around 8-12 months.
    > This describes the Babinski reflex.

question: 7\. Which reflex is considered an evolutionary remnant with no clear adaptive significance in modern humans?
---

- [ ] Rooting reflex
    > Rooting has a clear adaptive survival value as it helps the infant find the nipple for feeding.
- [ ] Sucking reflex
    > Sucking has a clear adaptive survival value for feeding.
- [x] Tonic neck reflex
    > The lecture notes state that while some reflexes like rooting/sucking have adaptive value, others like the tonic neck reflex have no clear adaptive significance. (Note: The Grasping/Plantar reflex is noted as an evolutionary remnant helping cling to a mother, but Tonic Neck is explicitly cited as having no clear significance).
- [ ] Swallowing reflex
    > Swallowing is essential for survival (feeding).

question: 8\. When does the "Babinski" reflex typically disappear, and what does its persistence suggest?
---

- [ ] Disappears at 2 months; persistence suggests extraordinary athletic potential.
    > The stepping reflex disappears around 2 months, not Babinski. Persistence is generally a bad sign.
- [ ] Disappears at 4 months; persistence is normal for breastfed babies.
    > The palmar grasping reflex disappears around 4 months.
- [ ] Disappears at 6 months; persistence indicates vision problems.
    > The Moro reflex disappears around 6 months.
- [x] Disappears around 8-12 months; persistence might indicate neurological problems.
    > The Babinski reflex (toes fanning out and curling when the foot is stroked) disappears around 8-12 months. Long-term persistence can indicate neurological problems.

question: 9\. According to the maturation of the Primary Motor Cortex (M1), in what order does voluntary control develop?
---

- [x] Head -> Arms and Trunk -> Legs
    > Development of the cortex begins with raising the head (1 month), followed by control of arms and trunk (3 months), and leg control is the last to develop.
- [ ] Legs -> Trunk -> Arms -> Head
    > This is the reverse of the actual developmental sequence (Cephalocaudal trend).
- [ ] Hands (fine motor) -> Trunk (gross motor) -> Legs
    > Control typically flows from gross to fine and head to toe. Trunk control comes before sophisticated hand control.
- [ ] All areas develop simultaneously at 6 months.
    > Development is sequential, starting as early as 1 month with head control.

question: 10\. Thelen's experiments with the stepping reflex involved suspending infants in water. What was the result?
---

- [ ] The water made the infants too cold to move.
    > Temperature was not the variable; buoyancy was.
- [x] Infants who no longer showed the stepping reflex on land began stepping again in the water.
    > When infants were suspended waist-deep in a tank of water that supported their weight, those who no longer showed the reflex on land performed the stepping motion, proving the neural basis remained but was masked by gravity/weight.
- [ ] Infants stopped stepping immediately due to the sensory distraction of water.
    > The opposite occurred; the water allowed the behavior to re-emerge.
- [ ] The water had no effect; only adding weights changed the behavior.
    > Water *did* have an effect (re-emergence), while adding weights to younger infants *stopped* the behavior. Both manipulations supported the importance of the weight-to-strength ratio.

question: 11\. Which of the following is true regarding the impact of culture on motor development, specifically in Mali?
---

- [ ] Mothers avoid handling babies to protect their fragile joints, delaying development.
    > The lecture notes show the opposite: mothers actively exercise infants.
- [x] Mothers exercise their infants with maneuvers that hasten early motor skills.
    > Mothers in Mali believe it is important to exercise infants (e.g., hanging/stretching maneuvers). Research (Bril & Sabatier, 1986) shows these do not harm babies and actually hasten early motor skills.
- [ ] Cultural practices have absolutely no impact on the timing of motor milestones.
    > The evidence from Mali suggests cultural practices *can* influence the timing (hastening) of milestones.
- [ ] The maneuvers used in Mali are harmful and cause long-term physical damage.
    > The lecture explicitly states the maneuvers shown "do not harm the babies."

question: 12\. What effect has the "Back to Sleep" campaign (placing babies on backs to reduce SIDS) had on motor development?
---

- [ ] It has caused a permanent delay in walking ability.
    > Research shows no differences in the development of crawling/walking by 18 months.
- [ ] It has accelerated the development of arm strength.
    > It likely causes arm strength to develop more *slowly* due to less "tummy time".
- [x] It makes infants less likely to roll over on schedule, but does not affect crawling development by 18 months.
    > The campaign reduces SIDS risk but infants are less likely to roll over on schedule (possibly due to better view on back/less motivation, or less arm strength). However, by 18 months, there are no differences in crawling development.
- [ ] It has completely eliminated the Moro reflex in newborns.
    > Sleeping position does not eliminate innate reflexes like the Moro reflex.

question: 13\. At what age do infants typically begin successfully reaching for objects (as opposed to pre-reaching)?
---

- [ ] Birth to 1 month
    > This period is characterized by "pre-reaching" (clumsy swiping), not successful reaching.
- [x] 3 to 4 months
    > Infants begin successfully reaching for objects at around 3 to 4 months of age.
- [ ] 7 to 8 months
    > By 7 months, reaching becomes stable as they sit independently, but the onset of successful reaching is earlier.

question: 15\. What is the "Visual Cliff" paradigm primarily used to test?
---

- [ ] The strength of the stepping reflex.
    > The stepping reflex is tested by holding the baby upright, not on a glass table.
- [x] Depth perception and wariness of heights in infants.
    > The visual cliff uses a glass table with an apparent drop to test if infants perceive depth and if they avoid the deep side (wariness of heights).
- [ ] The development of the pincer grasp.
    > This is a test of fine motor skills, not depth perception.
- [ ] The infant's ability to recognize their mother's face.
    > While the mother often stands at the other side, the core test is about depth perception and locomotion, not face recognition.

question: 16\. In the study by Campos et al. (1970) regarding the visual cliff, what was found about 1.5-month-old infants?
---

- [ ] They showed strong fear (increased heart rate) when placed on the deep side.
    > They did not show fear; fear develops later with crawling experience.
- [ ] They could not perceive the difference in depth at all.
    > They *could* perceive the difference, indicated by a heart rate change.
- [x] They could perceive the difference in depth (heart rate change) but showed no fear.
    > 1.5-month-old infants showed a heart rate change (deceleration/interest) indicating they perceived the depth, but they did not show fear (which would be acceleration). Fear is associated with the onset of locomotion (crawling).
- [ ] They immediately tried to crawl across the deep side.

type: single
question: 17\. What is "Social Referencing" in the context of the visual cliff experiment?
---

- [ ] The infant ignores the parent to focus on the cliff.
    > Social referencing specifically involves *using* the other person's reaction.
- [x] The use of another's emotional reaction to interpret an ambiguous situation.
    > Infants use social referencing (e.g., looking at the mother's face) to decide whether to cross the visual cliff. If the mother looks fearful, they won't cross; if she smiles, they are more likely to cross.
- [ ] The infant's preference for playing with other babies.
    > This is social interaction, not referencing for ambiguity resolution.
- [ ] The ability to recognize oneself in a mirror.
    > This refers to self-recognition/theory of mind, not social referencing.

type: single
question: 18\. What are "Affordances" in the context of perceptual and motor development?
---

- [ ] The cost of energy required to perform a movement.
    > Affordances refer to action possibilities, not energy expenditure.
- [ ] Genetic limitations on how tall a child can grow.
    > This refers to biological constraints, not affordances.
- [x] Properties of objects that lend themselves to particular ways of interacting with them.
    > As infants learn about objects, they perceive affordances—properties that allow for specific interactions (e.g., a chair affords sitting, beans afford eating or squishing).
- [ ] The reflexes that are present at birth.
    > Reflexes are innate behaviors, whereas affordances are properties of the environment/objects perceived by the infant.

question: 19\. What is a "Scale Error"?
---

- [ ] When a child misjudges the weight of an object.
    > This is a judgement error, but "scale error" specifically refers to size relative to the body.
- [x] When a toddler tries to treat a miniature replica object as if it was a much larger real one.
    > Toddlers make scale errors (e.g., trying to sit in a tiny dollhouse chair or get into a tiny toy car) because they fail to integrate visual information about size with action planning.
- [ ] When an infant falls while trying to scale a furniture item.
    > This is a motor accident, not the cognitive/perceptual phenomenon known as a scale error.
- [ ] When a child cannot distinguish between two different colors.
    > This is a visual discrimination issue.

- [ ] Dissociation between dorsal (action) and ventral (perception) visual streams.
    > This is a proposed theory: the visual info for planning isn't integrated with execution.
- [ ] Failure to inhibit an automatically afforded action.
    > This is a proposed theory: the object (chair) triggers the action (sit) automatically.
- [ ] Centration (focusing on one aspect of the object).
    > This is a proposed theory, relating to cognitive limitations.
- [x] Lack of muscle strength to handle the miniature objects.
    > Scale errors are cognitive/perceptual errors where the child attempts the action; it is not caused by a lack of muscle strength to handle the object.

question: 21\. What did Campos et al. (2000) find regarding infants using a powered mobility device?
---

- [ ] The device delayed their ability to walk independently.
    > The study was about the psychological effects of self-locomotion, not delaying walking.
- [x] It accelerated the development of wariness of heights/depth.
    > Infants who used the powered mobility device (allowing them to move before they could crawl) developed wariness of heights/depth earlier than those who could not move independently. This supports the link between self-locomotion and depth perception.
- [ ] It caused the infants to lose their grasping reflex.
    > There is no evidence that mobility devices affect the grasping reflex.

- [ ] Human babies walk immediately after birth.
    > Humans do not walk immediately; this is false.
- [x] Human toes are too short for proper grasping, yet the reflex persists.
    > The reflex appears in the foot as well as the hand, potentially to help primate ancestors cling to mothers, but human toes are now too short for this to be functional, suggesting it is an evolutionary remnant.
- [ ] The reflex is only present in adults, not babies.

question: 27\. How does the concept of "Specificity of motor learning" apply to the transition from crawling to walking?
---

- [ ] Infants who are good crawlers are immediately good walkers.
    > Specificity suggests the opposite: skills don't transfer.
- [ ] Infants use the same muscle groups for both, so learning is cumulative.
    > While muscles are used, the balance and perceptual requirements differ.
- [x] Infants do not transfer learning about slopes from crawling to walking.
    > Karen Adolph found that infants do not transfer knowledge (e.g., "this slope is too steep") from crawling to walking. They must relearn the affordances for the new posture ("Toddler gait").

- [ ] It is a condition where the hand refuses to move.

- [x] It involves a failure to inhibit an automatically afforded action, similar to scale errors.
    > Patients with medial frontal lobe damage may show "utilisation behaviour" (using objects automatically upon seeing them). This is analogous to toddlers making scale errors because they cannot inhibit the action that the object "affords" (e.g., a chair affords sitting), even if the size is wrong.
