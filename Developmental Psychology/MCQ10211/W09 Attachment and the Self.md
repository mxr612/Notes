question: 1\. Baby Kim is taking part in a Strange Situation task with her mother. Throughout the experiment, Kim is clingy, is extremely distressed when separated from her mother, and refuses to be comforted by the experimenter. Her mother's attempt to comfort her does not seem to help either. To which attachment category is Kim likely to belong?
---

- [ ] Insecure avoidant attachment
    > Insecure avoidant children tend to be indifferent toward the caregiver, avoid them upon return, and are as easily comforted by a stranger as by the caregiver.
- [ ] Disorganised attachment
    > Disorganised attachment is characterized by confused or contradictory behaviours, such as appearing dazed or disoriented, rather than a consistent strategy of resistance.
- [x] Insecure resistant attachment
    > Insecure-resistant (or ambivalent) attachment is characterised by children who are clingy and stay close to the caregiver rather than exploring. In the Strange Situation, they become very upset when separated, are not comforted by strangers, and resist comfort from the caregiver upon reunion (both seeking comfort and resisting it).
- [ ] Secure attachment
    > Securely attached infants may be upset when the caregiver leaves but are happy to see them return and recover quickly from distress. They use the caregiver as a secure base.

question: 2\. Infants exhibit their developing sense of self in which of the following orders?
---

- [ ] Displaying embarrassment in social situations, recognising self in a photograph, recognising self in a mirror
    > This order is incorrect. Embarrassment appears last (around age 3).
- [ ] Displaying embarrassment in social situations, recognising self in a mirror, recognising self in a photograph
    > This order is incorrect. Mirror recognition occurs before embarrassment.
- [ ] Recognising self in a photograph, recognising self in a mirror, displaying embarrassment in social situations
    > This order is incorrect. Mirror recognition (18-20 months) typically precedes photograph recognition (30 months).
- [x] Recognising self in a mirror, recognising self in a photograph, displaying embarrassment in social situations
    > Research indicates the developmental timeline of the self is: Mirror recognition occurs around 18-20 months (Lewis & Brooks-Gunn, 1979); recognising one's own photograph occurs around 30 months (Bullock & Lutkenhaus, 1990); and expressions of embarrassment/shame indicate self-awareness around 3 years old (Lewis, 1995).

question: 3\. Which of the following statements is true regarding the long-term consequences of secure attachment style?
---

- [ ] Securely attached children achieve greater academic attainment
    > This is true (Jacobsen & Hofmann, 1997), but it is not the only correct statement among the options.
- [ ] Secure attachment predicts positive peer relationships in adolescence
    > This is true (Collins, 1996), but it is not the only correct statement among the options.
- [ ] Children who were securely attached as infants show better emotional health later in development
    > This is true (Collins, 1996), but it is not the only correct statement among the options.
- [x] All of the above
    > Research suggests multiple long-term benefits of secure attachment, including closer/harmonious relationships with peers (Vondra et al., 2001), positive peer/romantic relationships and emotional health in adolescence (Collins, 1996), and higher grades/school involvement (Jacobsen & Hofmann, 1997).

question: 4\. According to the lecture, which of the following best describes the core definition of attachment?
---

- [x] A deep and enduring emotional bond that connects one person to another across time and space
    > Attachment is defined as a deep and enduring emotional bond that connects one person to another across time and space. While research often focuses on the mother-infant dyad, attachment figures can include biological or non-biological parents, grandparents, and siblings.
- [ ] A dependency on a caregiver solely for the provision of food and nutrition
    > Attachment goes beyond food provision; it involves emotional bonding, comfort, and safety, as demonstrated by Harlow's research.
- [ ] A temporary connection formed during the first few hours of life that fades after infancy
    > Attachment is described as "enduring" across time and space, not a temporary connection that fades.
- [ ] An unconscious fantasy about the primary caregiver as proposed by psychoanalysis
    > Bowlby specifically moved away from unconscious fantasies (psychoanalysis) to focus on actual experiences and real-world relationships.

question: 5\. In Konrad Lorenz's research on imprinting with graylag geese, what was the significance of the "critical period"?
---

- [ ] It was the period during which the geese learned to fly.
    > The research focused on attachment/following behaviour, not flying.
- [x] It was the timeframe (13-16 hours after hatching) during which the geese formed a connection with the first moving stimulus.
    > Lorenz compared naturally hatched geese with incubator-hatched ones. The incubator-hatched geese imprinted on Lorenz because he was the first moving stimulus they saw during the critical period (between 13-16 hours after hatching).
- [ ] It was the period in which the geese rejected any non-biological parent.
    > The geese did not reject non-biological parents; they imprinted on Lorenz (a human) because he was the stimulus present during the critical period.
- [ ] It was the duration required for the geese to recognize their own reflection.
    > Mirror recognition is a concept related to the sense of self in humans (around 18-20 months), not imprinting in geese.

question: 6\. Harry Harlow’s research with rhesus monkeys demonstrated the importance of "contact comfort". What was the key finding?
---

- [ ] Monkeys preferred the wire mother because she provided food.
    > The monkeys did not prefer the wire mother; they only went to her for food but did not stay for comfort.
- [ ] Monkeys showed no preference between the wire mother and the cloth mother.
    > There was a distinct preference shown in the study.
- [ ] Monkeys attached to the wire mother only if the cloth mother was removed.
    > The monkeys preferred the cloth mother even when fed by the wire mother.
- [x] Monkeys felt attached to the cloth mother even when they were fed by the wire mother.
    > Harlow separated monkeys from biological mothers and presented two surrogates: a wire one with food and a cloth one with soft "skin". The monkeys felt attached to the cloth mother for "contact comfort" even when the wire mother provided the food.

question: 7\. According to Bowlby's 4 phases of attachment, in which phase does the infant begin to show "clear-cut attachment" and separation distress?
---

- [ ] Phase 1: Preattachment phase (birth to 6 weeks)
    > In this phase, infants produce innate signals to bring others close but do not yet show clear attachment to specific individuals.
- [ ] Phase 2: Attachment-in-the-making (6 weeks to 6-8 months)
    > Infants respond preferentially to familiar people but do not yet show the specific distress associated with clear-cut attachment.
- [x] Phase 3: Clear-cut attachment (6-8 months to 1-2 years)
    > In this phase, the infant actively seeks contact with their regular caregiver(s) and protests or shows distress when the caregiver departs.
- [ ] Phase 4: Reciprocal relationships (from 1 or 2 years onward)
    > In this phase, the child takes an active role in developing working partnerships with the caregiver, rather than just seeking proximity/comfort.

question: 8\. What is the "Internal Working Model" (IWM) in the context of attachment theory?
---

- [ ] A laboratory procedure used to assess infant attachment styles.
    > This refers to the Strange Situation Procedure, not the IWM.
- [ ] A genetic predisposition to seek food from the mother.
    > This refers to evolutionary drives for survival/food, not the mental representation of relationships.
- [x] A mental representation formulated by the child based on early relationships with caregivers.
    > By early childhood, the child formulates an IWM. If the relationship with caregivers is positive, they form a positive IWM; if unloving/unsupportive, they form a negative IWM. It guides future interactions and expectations.
- [ ] A stage of development where the child recognizes themselves in a mirror.
    > This refers to the development of the sense of self, specifically mirror recognition.

    > Reaction to the stranger is assessed in Episode 3 when the stranger enters.
- [x] Exploration and use of parent as a secure base.
    > In Episode 2, the caregiver and child are alone. The caregiver is told not to initiate interaction. The focus is on observing the child's exploration of the environment and their use of the parent as a secure base.
- [ ] Separation distress.
    > Separation distress is assessed in Episodes 4 and 6 when the parent leaves.
- [ ] Ability to be soothed by a stranger.

- [ ] Dazed or disoriented behavior, often contradictory.
    > This characterizes Disorganised attachment.
- [x] Indifference toward the caregiver and being as easily comforted by a stranger as by the caregiver.
    > Insecure-avoidant children seem indifferent toward the caregiver before they leave and indifferent/avoidant when they return. If upset, they are as easily comforted by a stranger as by the caregiver.

question: 13\. The "Disorganised/Disoriented" attachment category was added later by Main & Solomon (1990). Which of the following is true about infants in this category?
---

- [ ] They consistently avoid the caregiver to reduce stress.
    > Consistent avoidance is a strategy of the Insecure-Avoidant category.
- [x] They display confused or contradictory behaviours, such as appearing dazed or disoriented.
    > Infants in this category seem to have no consistent way of coping with stress. Their behaviour is confused/contradictory (e.g., approaching with back turned) and they appear dazed. They are also assigned an underlying original category (Secure/Avoidant/Resistant).
- [ ] They represent the majority of infants in low-income families.
    > While stress can increase prevalence, they are a "small percentage" of children generally, not the majority.
- [ ] They are the most independent and exploratory of all categories.
    > This is not accurate; their behaviour indicates a lack of a coherent strategy, not independence.

---

- [x] The infant's attachment style is determined by just a few minutes of separation and reunion.
    > Critics argue that determining a relationship style based on a brief, artificial laboratory separation may not reflect real-world interactions fully.
- [ ] It is unethical to separate a mother from a child for any length of time.
    > While ethics are debated, the "ecological validity" specifically refers to how well the lab test represents real life, not the morality of it.
- [ ] It cannot distinguish between twins.
    > This is not a primary methodological criticism mentioned in the lecture.
