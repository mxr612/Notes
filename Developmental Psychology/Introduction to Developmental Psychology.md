Children has its inborn rationality, and use it for self-control.

- Believed that children are born with innate knowledge 

**Aristotle (empiricist):**
Children shape themselves by experiences, therefore have various need.

- Was concerned with fitting child-rearing to the needs of the individual child
- Believed that knowledge comes from experience 

### 2.2. Later philosophers (1700s): Nature vs. Nurture

**Respect nature:** Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the French philosopher, argued that parents and society should give the child maximum freedom from the beginning.

**Emphasize nurture:** Like Aristotle, the English philosopher John Locke saw the child as a tabula rasa (blank slate) and advocated first instilling discipline, then gradually increasing the child’s freedom.
