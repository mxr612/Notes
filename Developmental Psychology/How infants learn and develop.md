Infants learn an enormous amount in a very short space of time – a remarkable achievement enabled by a variety of learning mechanisms

## 1. Testing learning

Newborn infants can recognize rhymes and stories presented before birth. They prefer smells, taste and sound patterns that are familiar in prenatal exposure.
## 2. Habituation & Dishabituation

A decrease in responsiveness to repeated stimulation reveals that learning has occurred
- The infant has a memory representation of the repeated, now-familiar stimulus
- The speed with which an infant habituates is believed to reflect the general efficiency of the infant’s processing of information
- Some continuity has been found between these measures in infancy and general cognitive ability later in life
### 2.1. looking experiment (Maurer & Maurer, 1985)

- 3-months old – pictures of faces
- At the 1st appearance of a photo of a face, her eyes widen and she stares intently
- With 3 more presentations of the same picture, her interest wanes and a yawn appears: habituation
- By its 5th appearance, other things are attracting the baby’s attention
- When a new face finally appears, her interest in something novel is evident: dishabituation

### 2.2. sucking experiment (Eimas, 1985)

- Allow infant to suck on a dummy that is connected to a computer and measure baseline sucking rate – Present phoneme (/pa/) repeatedly
- Sucking rate first increases and then infant habituates (i.e., returns to baseline sucking rate)
- Present new phoneme (/ba/) – Infant dishabituates (i.e. sucking rate increases)
