### Ethical issues in developmental research

Researchers have a vital responsibility to:
- Ensure the research does not harm the children physically or psychologically
- Obtain informed consent from parents/guardians and the child (if the child is old enough to understand)
- Preserve the anonymity of the children who take part â€“ Counteract any negative outcomes
and correct any inaccurate impressions that arise during the study
