## 1. Explain the principles of Reflexive Thematic Analysis

### 1.1. Overview of Thematic Analysis (TA)

- **Purpose**: Identifies, analyses, and reports patterns (themes) across qualitative data
- **Focus**: Explores what is meaningful about a topic and represents shared experiences/ideas
- **Characteristics**:
  - Flexible - applicable to various data types and research questions
  - Not tied to one theoretical framework
  - Accessible and well-suited for student projects

### 1.2. Three Versions of Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2021)

#### 1.2.1. Coding Reliability or Structured Approaches

- Influenced by quantitative traditions
- Researcher as relatively neutral observer
- Aims for coding consistency and replicability
- Uses shared codebooks and inter-rater reliability checks
- Values consistency and replicability
- Common in large team-based projects or applied settings

#### 1.2.2. Codebook or Hybrid Approaches

- Middle ground between structured and reflexive forms
- Begins with collaboratively developed codebook
- Allows flexibility for new ideas to emerge
- Acknowledges interpretation while maintaining structure
- Useful for projects needing both rigor and comparability

#### 1.2.3. Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA)

- **Emphasizes**: Researcher's active and interpretive role
- **No single "correct" set** of codes or themes
- **Analysis is**: Creative, flexible, and reflexive
- **Values**: Depth, transparency, and reflexive awareness
- **Coding**: Organic and evolving, not fixed or rule-bound
- **Meaning construction**: Through interaction between researcher and data

### 1.3. Theoretical Foundations of RTA

#### 1.3.1. Constructivist and Interpretivist Assumptions

- **Constructivism**: Meaning is constructed through experiences, language, and social interactions
- **Interpretivism**: Focuses on understanding how people make sense of experiences
- **Key principle**: Meaning is **produced, not discovered**

#### 1.3.2. Constructing Meaning in Practice

- **Meaning is produced, not discovered**: Themes are developed through reflective interpretation
- **Researcher-data connection**: Background, assumptions, and interests influence interpretation
- **Themes are interpretive**: Explore what accounts mean in research context, not just summarize

### 1.4. From Description to Interpretation

#### 1.4.1. Descriptive vs. Interpretive Analysis

**Example**: Interviews about cooking and eating experiences

**Descriptive Reading** (Surface level):

- "People enjoy eating with others because it feels more sociable and fun"
- Stays close to surface content of data

**Interpretive Reading** (Deeper meaning):

- Explores cultural/emotional meanings of sharing food
- Examines how food practices relate to identity, care, or social connection
- **Potential themes**: "Food as expression of care" or "Cooking as relational work"

#### 1.4.2. Key Distinction

- **Description**: Tells us what participants said or did
- **Interpretion**: Helps us understand what those words/actions mean in context

### 1.5. Core Principles of Reflexive Thematic Analysis

1. **Active Researcher Role**: Researcher is not neutral but actively constructs meaning
2. **Reflexivity**: Continuous awareness of how researcher's perspective shapes analysis
3. **Organic Process**: Coding and theme development evolve naturally
4. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of analytical decisions and reasoning
5. **Interpretive Depth**: Moves beyond description to explore underlying meanings
6. **Contextual Understanding**: Considers broader social and psychological contexts

### 1.6. Practical Implications for Analysis

- **No predetermined codebook**: Codes emerge from engagement with data
- **Iterative process**: Move back and forth between data and emerging themes
- **Reflexive documentation**: Keep notes on analytical decisions and personal reflections
- **Theme development**: Focus on meaningful patterns rather than frequency counts
- **Interpretive storytelling**: Themes capture core ideas and relationships in data

## 2. Describe the Six Phases of Thematic Analysis

### 2.1. Overview of the Six-Phase Process (Braun & Clarke, 2006, 2021)

- **Structured but flexible** process for moving from raw data to meaningful themes
- **Iterative and recursive** - move back and forth between phases as understanding develops
- **Guides thinking** rather than providing rigid formula

### 2.2. The Six Phases

#### 2.2.1. Familiarisation with the Data

- **Purpose**: Immerse yourself in the data to know it thoroughly
- **Activities**: Read and re-read transcripts, listen to recordings, note ideas/emotions/recurring issues
- **Goal**: Notice what stands out, surprises, or seems relevant (not yet analysis)
- **Importance**: Foundation for deeper analysis; skipping leads to superficial coding

#### 2.2.2. Generating Initial Codes

- **Purpose**: Identify interesting or meaningful features in the data
- **Codes**: Concise labels capturing important aspects of text segments
- **Process**: Break dataset into manageable pieces for pattern recognition
- **RTA Approach**: Flexible, interpretive coding - multiple codes per extract, revisable

#### 2.2.3. Searching for Themes

- **Purpose**: Look across dataset to see how codes cluster together
- **Themes**: Broader patterns of meaning that answer research questions
- **Activities**: Group codes, rename/merge them, map connections between ideas
- **Characteristics**: Exploratory phase requiring creativity and reflection

#### 2.2.4. Reviewing Potential Themes

- **Purpose**: Check how well themes fit coded data and entire dataset
- **Process**: Combine, split, or discard themes based on scrutiny
- **Goal**: Ensure each theme captures coherent, meaningful, distinct pattern
- **Importance**: Adds rigor and maintains link between data and interpretation

#### 2.2.5. Defining and Naming Themes

- **Purpose**: Refine and articulate what each theme captures and why it matters
- **Activities**: Identify theme "essence," consider relationships with other themes
- **Naming**: Develop clear names that communicate meaning
- **Outcome**: Deepens interpretation and prepares for writing

#### 2.2.6. Producing the Report

- **Purpose**: Weave themes into coherent narrative telling analytic story
- **Activities**: Select vivid extracts, link findings to research question and literature
- **Writing as Analysis**: Writing process itself clarifies and communicates meaning

### 2.3. Why the Phases Matter

- **Structure and transparency**: Systematic work and clear explanation of decisions
- **Iterative nature**: Revisit earlier phases as ideas evolve
- **Connected process**: Each phase contributes to moving from data to insight
- **Progression**: From what participants said → what their words mean in research context

### 2.4. Iterative Nature of the Process

- Familiarisation informs coding
- Reviewing themes may prompt new codes
- Writing can refine interpretation
- Continuous movement between phases as understanding deepens

## 3. Describe and apply the process of data familiarisation

### 3.1. Overview of Data Familiarisation

- **First phase** of thematic analysis - foundation for everything that follows
- **Goal**: Become deeply immersed in dataset to understand:
  - What participants said
  - How they said it
  - Contexts that give their words meaning
- **Not analysis yet** - getting to know the data

### 3.2. Process of Familiarisation

- **Careful, repeated engagement** with data
- **Activities**:
  - Reading and re-reading transcripts
  - Listening to recordings
  - Noticing ideas, emotions, and patterns
- **Where relationship with data begins** to take shape

### 3.3. Conceptual Understanding

- **Purpose**: Why immersion matters and how it strengthens later analysis
- **Connection**: Links to reflexive, interpretive nature of thematic analysis
- **More than quick read-through**: Requires slowing down to really listen and observe

### 3.4. Practical Strategies for Data Familiarisation

- **Active reading and annotation**
- **Listening carefully** to tone and emphasis in recordings
- **Making brief analytic and reflexive notes**
- **Managing and organising transcripts** effectively
- **Building habits** of careful observation and reflection

### 3.5. Key Idea

- **Familiarisation is about**: Immersion, curiosity, and reflection
- **Stronger understanding now** → deeper analysis later

## 4. Describe and apply the process of coding qualitative data

### 4.1. Overview of Coding

- **Next stage** after data familiarisation
- **Purpose**: Begin organising data by identifying and labelling key features relevant to research question
- **Bridge between raw text and deeper analysis**
- **More than highlighting**: Making analytic choices

### 4.2. Nature of Codes

- **Capture meaningful elements**: Ideas, emotions, or concepts
- **Help make sense** of the data
- **Transform large, unstructured dataset** into meaningful building blocks

### 4.3. Conceptual Understanding of Coding

- **Essential to thematic analysis** process
- **Two types of codes**:
  - **Semantic codes**: Stay close to surface meaning of what participants said
  - **Latent codes**: Interpret underlying ideas or assumptions
- **Iterative process**: Revisit and refine as understanding deepens

### 4.4. Practical Coding Process

- **Reading through transcripts** and identifying data extracts worth coding
- **Writing clear, concise code labels**
- **Examples of semantic and latent codes**
- **Practical ways to keep coding consistent**
- **Systematic and confident** coding approach

### 4.5. Key Idea

- **Coding is the bridge** between data and analysis
- **Transforms what participants said** into meaningful insights

## 5. Identify the qualities of a strong thematic analysis

### 5.1. Understanding Quality in RTA

- **Not about rigid checklists** or "right" answers
- **About**: Careful thinking, systematic work, and honest reflection
- **Acknowledges researcher's role** in the process

### 5.2. Four Principles of Quality (Braun & Clarke, 2021)

#### 5.2.1. Coherence

- **Clear and convincing story** about data
- **Themes fit together logically**
- **Aligns with research question** and theoretical approach
- **Visible "thread"** connecting data extracts to overall interpretation

#### 5.2.2. Transparency

- **Shows how conclusions were reached**
- **Makes analytic process visible**
- **Describes generation, review, and refinement** of codes and themes
- **Helps others understand reasoning** behind decisions

#### 5.2.3. Depth

- **Goes beyond summarising** what participants said
- **Interprets patterns of shared meaning**
- **Identifies "fully realised themes"** - not just topic summaries
- **Reveals important insights** about how people make sense of experiences

#### 5.2.4. Reflexivity

- **Acknowledges researcher's active role**
- **Recognises how background, values, and assumptions** shape interpretation
- **Adds honesty and depth** to work
- **Not about eliminating influence** but reflecting on it

### 5.3. Foundation of Quality in RTA

- **Interpretive, creative, and transparent** process
- **Constructing meaning** rather than mechanical analysis
- **Combined principles** form foundation for rigorous qualitative work

## 6. Reflect on and articulate your role in the analysis through a reflexive statement

### 6.1. Importance of Reflexivity

- **Researchers are not neutral observers**
- **Background, beliefs, and experiences** shape data interpretation
- **Reflexive statement**: Helps think about these influences for more thoughtful, transparent work

### 6.2. What is a Reflexive Statement?

- **Short piece of writing** about how background, assumptions, and experiences affect analysis
- **Not about "right answers"** - about awareness of interpretive influence
- **Helps**:
  - Recognise own perspective
  - Stay open to new patterns
  - Be transparent about analytic choices
  - Strengthen quality and honesty

### 6.3. Timing of Reflection

- **Before beginning analysis** - approach with more awareness and care
- **Saves time later** - material ready for write-up stage

### 6.4. Reflective Workbook Activity

#### 6.4.1. Reflection Prompts

- **Ideas or expectations** brought to the topic
- **Background, experiences, or identity** influences (age, culture, education)
- **Feelings during data collection** (interviewing or being interviewed)
- **Strengths brought to analysis**
- **Challenges perspective might create**
- **Strategies to stay open and reflective** during coding

#### 6.4.2. Format Guidelines

- **Brief notes or bullet points** acceptable
- **Detailed enough** to remind of thinking at this stage
- **Will be returned to** when writing lab report
- **Normal discomfort** - goal is careful thinking, not personal sharing

### 6.5. Practical Benefits

- **Increases awareness** of interpretive lens
- **Enhances transparency** in research process
- **Strengthens analytical rigor**
- **Supports development** as reflexive researcher
