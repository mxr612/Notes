## 1. Evaluate the Implications of Qualitative Research Design Decisions

### 1.1. Designing Qualitative Research

Every successful piece of research begins with a strong foundation. In qualitative research, that foundation is your **research design** - a flexible but purposeful "blueprint" that guides your project.

**Key Benefits:**

- Saves time
- Ensures respect for participants  
- Produces meaningful findings
- Keeps questions, theories, and methods in conversation

### 1.2. How Design Shapes Knowledge

Design choices in qualitative research are never neutral - they shape:
- What you discover
- How others understand your findings
- The very knowledge you create

**Reflective Question:** Why is your research important right now? What will it add to knowledge, practice, or society?

## 2. Philosophical Assumptions and Reflexivity

### 2.1. Philosophical Assumptions

Behind every research project lie deeper ideas about the world and how we come to know it. These assumptions shape every aspect of qualitative research.

### 2.2. Ontology - Ideas about the Nature of Reality

**Key Questions:**

- Is reality fixed and discoverable?
- Does it depend on human perspective and interpretation?

**Ontological Positions:**

- **Realism:** Reality exists independently of human understanding
- **Relativism:** Reality is shaped by human understanding and context

### 2.3. Epistemology - How We Can Know and Understand the World

**Epistemological Perspectives:**

- **Quantitative traditions:** Positivist/post-positivist - emphasize objective observation to uncover truths
- **Qualitative traditions:** Constructionist - highlight how knowledge is created through interpretation, context, and meaning-making

### 2.4. Reflexivity in Qualitative Research

The researcher is not a detached observer - who you are shapes how you do research.

**Why Reflexivity Matters:**

- Recognizes researcher influence
- Strengthens research process and findings
- Creates more thoughtful, transparent, and trustworthy research

**Reflexive Strategies:**

- Journaling
- Regular self-reflection
- Acknowledging background, assumptions, and choices

Qualitative Data Collection Strategies

### 2.5. Introduction to Qualitative Data Collection

Qualitative data is rich, detailed, and often consists of words, images, or observations.

**Key Principle:** Choose approaches that fit your questions, participants, and context.

### 2.6. Semi-Structured Interviews

- Balance between guidance and flexibility
- Like guided conversations
- Produce deep, detailed insights
- Work well face-to-face or online

### 2.7. Types of Interviews

| Type | Description | Commonly Used In | Strengths | Limitations |
|------|-------------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Structured** | Questions fully predetermined | Quantitative research | - Easy to replicate<br>- Standardized data<br>- Easy comparison | - Limited depth<br>- No unexpected issues |
| **Semi-Structured** | Key questions with flexibility | Qualitative research (most common) | - Balance consistency/flexibility<br>- Explores unanticipated themes<br>- Accessible | - Requires skill to follow up<br>- Less standardized |
| **Unstructured** | Broad themes, participant-led | Some qualitative research | - Rich, in-depth accounts<br>- Participant perspectives<br>- Empowers participants | - Time-consuming<br>- Difficult to analyze systematically |

### 2.8. Focus Groups

- Use social interaction to generate data
- Powerful for exploring collective views or social meanings
- Not ideal for highly personal or sensitive topics

### 2.9. Textual Data Collection

**Sources:**

- Participant-generated surveys
- Media articles
- Online forums
- Political speeches

**Limitations:**

- No chance to probe further
- Less researcher control

## 3. Qualitative Analytic Approaches

### 3.1. Introduction to Qualitative Analysis

Process of making sense of gathered data by identifying patterns, themes, and insights.

**Aims of Qualitative Analysis:**

- Explore meaning
- Recognize patterns in language
- Pay attention to context
- Value participants' perspectives

### 3.2. Content Analysis

- Simple, flexible method
- Describes and organizes data systematically
- Good for large datasets or comparing patterns
- Focuses on surface-level content and frequency
- Aligns more with quantitative traditions

### 3.3. Thematic Analysis (TA)

- Most widely used approach
- Flexible, practical, and accessible
- Identifies and reports themes across data
- Requires careful use to go beyond description

### 3.4. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)

- Explores individual experiences in depth
- Focuses on lived experience
- Requires small samples
- Demands careful interpretative work

### 3.5. Grounded Theory (GT)

- Builds theory directly from data
- Useful for studying processes and social influences
- Iterative, systematic process
- Time-consuming and complex
- Involves constant comparison and memo-writing

## 4. Planning a Qualitative Research Project

### 4.1. Project Planning Framework

1. **Start with your research question**
2. **Choose an analysis approach**
3. **Decide how to collect your data**
4. **Identify your sample**
5. **Be realistic and practical**
6. **Keep everything aligned**

### 4.2. Case Study: First-Year Student Success Project

**Research Question:** "How do first-year students experience and understand success?"

**Breaking Down the Question:**

- "How do first-year students..." → Specific group: first-year university students
- "...experience and understand success?" → Personal experiences + interpretations

### 4.3. Reflective Questions for Research Design

1. **What kind of knowledge is this project trying to produce?**
   - Rich description of experiences
   - Testing a hypothesis  
   - Generating a theory

2. **What are the practical constraints of this project?**
   - Time available
   - Researcher experience
   - Access to participants

3. **Which type of data collection would be most appropriate, and why?**

4. **Which type of qualitative analysis would be most appropriate, and why?**
