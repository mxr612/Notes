## Population

A **population** is the complete set of individuals, objects, or measurements that possess some common characteristic that the researcher is interested in studying.

- **Population size**: $N$
- **Parameters**: Fixed numerical characteristics of the population (e.g., $\mu$, $\sigma$)
- **Examples**: All students at a university, all voters in a country, all products from a factory

## Sample 

A **sample** is a subset of the population selected for study. It should be representative of the population to allow valid inferences.

- **Sample size**: $n$
- **Statistics**: Numerical characteristics calculated from the sample (e.g., $\bar{x}$, $s$)
- **Purpose**: To estimate population parameters and make inferences

## Sampling

### Why Sample?

1. **Practicality**: Studying entire populations is often impossible or impractical
2. **Cost-effectiveness**: Samples require fewer resources than censuses
3. **Time efficiency**: Faster data collection and analysis
4. **Accuracy**: Well-designed samples can provide highly accurate estimates

### Sampling Methods

#### Probability Sampling (Random)
- **Simple Random Sampling**: Every member has equal chance of selection
- **Stratified Sampling**: Population divided into strata, then random sampling within each
- **Cluster Sampling**: Population divided into clusters, random clusters selected
- **Systematic Sampling**: Selecting every kth member from a list

#### Non-Probability Sampling
- **Convenience Sampling**: Using readily available participants
- **Purposive Sampling**: Selecting specific individuals who meet criteria
- **Snowball Sampling**: Participants refer other participants

### Sampling Error

**Sampling error** is the difference between a sample statistic and the corresponding population parameter. It occurs because we're studying a subset rather than the entire population.

- **Reduced by**: Larger sample sizes, better sampling methods
- **Quantified by**: Standard error, confidence intervals

### Representativeness

A sample is **representative** if its characteristics closely match those of the population. Key factors:

- **Sampling method**: Probability methods generally produce more representative samples
- **Sample size**: Larger samples tend to be more representative
- **Response rate**: High participation reduces potential bias

## Relationship to Parameter Estimation

Sampling provides the foundation for [[Parameter Estimation]]. Through careful sampling, we obtain data that allows us to:

1. Calculate sample statistics ($\bar{x}$, $s$, etc.)
2. Use these statistics to estimate population parameters ($\mu$, $\sigma$, etc.)
3. Quantify the uncertainty in our estimates
4. Make valid inferences about the population
