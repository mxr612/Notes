## Cognitive Basis

### Self Knowledge

#### Self schema

- the beliefs and ideas people hold about themselves
- Multiple! Wide range of self-schema (Markus, 1977)
- Working self-concept Context-dependent self; only some aspects active at any given time

#### Self Schema Development

- Self-schemas form through experience and feedback, guiding how we view ourselves and react to situations
	- Baby: no self-schema
	- ~18 months: emerging self-awareness (recognising self in mirror, "me" vs "not me")
	- ~5–6 years: simple self-statements ("I'm a good girl," "I like red," "I don't like Tommy")
	- ~13 years: more complex self-descriptions, reflecting personality, abilities, and relationships
- Schematic vs. Aschematic: some traits strongly integrated into self-concept (schematic), others less central (aschematic)

### Self Discrepancy Theory (Higgins, 1987)

People have three domains of the self:
- **Actual self** - who we believe we are
- **Ideal self** - who we want to be  
- **Ought self** - who we think we should be

Discrepancies between these selves lead to negative emotions:
- **Actual vs. Ideal** → sadness, disappointment
- **Actual vs. Ought** → anxiety, guilt

## Behaviour Ways

### Self Perception Theory 

- Attitude -> Behaviour: Behaviour can be guided by cognitions.
- Behaviour -> Attitude: Find what your status (feelings and actions), and redefine yourself.

#### Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation

- Intrinsic: doing something for internal satisfaction or interest (e.g., reading for fun).
- Extrinsic: doing something for external rewards or pressures (e.g., working for money, praise, or grades).

#### Overjustification Effect

- Overjustification Effect occurs when extrinsic rewards reduce intrinsic motivation for an activity already enjoyed.

Justify intrinsic by extrinsic.


### Social Comparison Theory

- People compare themselves to others to have a benchmark, or yardstick to measure how they are doing. 
- For many attributes there is no objective standard we can only compare.
- We seek out similar others to validate ourselves-how groups are formed

## Self Esteem

- Confidence in ones worth or abilities
- Judgement of the self and attitudes towards the self
- Self esteem predicts many clinical and non-clinical outcomes such as academic achievement, depression, criminal behaviour, relational success etc.

### Types of self-esteem

- Global: at any time, on a scale from negative to positive
- Domain: In one specific area
- Trait: Past perception of inclusion and exclusion
- State: Current inclusion and exclusion

### Self Enhancement Bias

- We are remarkably good at protecting our own self image
- Greater self-reflection on positive than on negative aspects of self
- Self Affirmation Theory - (Sherman & Cohen, 2006; Steele, 1988) 
- We act to affirm positive aspects of oneself
