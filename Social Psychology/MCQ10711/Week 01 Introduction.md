question: 1\. According to Allport's classic definition, social psychology examines how which factor shapes people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviours?
---

- [ ] Stable personality traits that are uninfluenced by context
    > Allport highlighted situational social influence rather than fixed traits as the driver.
- [x] The actual, imagined, or implied presence of others
    > His definition states that others' actual, imagined, or implied presence shapes thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.
- [ ] Large-scale economic forces over long periods
    > Macroeconomic trends are a sociological focus, not the immediate social presence emphasized by Allport.
- [ ] Biological maturation alone
    > Biological growth is not the social influence Allport described in his definition.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 2\. Compared with sociology, social psychology places its main emphasis on what?
---

- [x] How social contexts influence individual cognition and behaviour, often via experiments
    > Social psychology studies individuals in social contexts and frequently tests mechanisms experimentally.
- [ ] Describing macro-level demographic trends without testing mechanisms
    > Macro-level description without mechanisms is more characteristic of sociology than social psychology.
- [ ] Archival analysis of institutions without considering individuals
    > Ignoring individuals and focusing only on institutions misses social psychology's individual-level emphasis.
- [ ] Abandoning empirical methods in favour of philosophy
    > The field is empirical and does not replace data with pure philosophy.
```

question: 3\. Lewin's claim that "research that produces nothing but books will not suffice" reflects which priority for social psychology?
---

- [ ] Valuing theory more than evidence
    > Lewin argued for practical impact, not privileging theory over data.
- [ ] Prioritising philosophical debate over data
    > He advocated applied research rather than abstract debate.
- [x] Using research to generate interventions that solve social problems
    > Lewin's statement urged research to lead to interventions that address real social issues.

question: 4\. When Gergen (1973) suggested that establishing general principles could reduce social conflict, he was assuming that social psychology can...
---

- [ ] Remain purely descriptive and detached from application
    > The suggestion assumes application, not detachment from practice.
- [ ] Focus solely on within-person biology to explain conflict
    > Gergen pointed to social conditions, not only biological factors.
- [ ] Avoid drawing on evidence when proposing solutions
    > The claim relies on evidence-based principles, not ignoring data.

question: 5\. Kahneman's test of learning psychology is best captured by which outcome?
---

- [x] Your understanding of real situations changes, not just your store of facts
    > Kahneman says you have learned when your view of the world shifts, not when you only accumulate facts.
- [ ] You can memorise every researcher name linked to a topic
    > Memorising names is rote recall, not the deeper learning he describes.
- [ ] You recall definitions verbatim without being able to use them
    > Quoting definitions without application fails Kahneman's standard for learning.
- [ ] You recite classic experiments but cannot explain their meaning
    > Recitation without changed understanding does not meet his test of learning.

type: single
question: 8\. The anti-smoking example highlighted which risk for babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy?
---

    > No evidence suggests smoking improves infant immunity or temperament.
- [ ] No measurable differences from babies of non-smokers
    > The example warned of harm, not equivalence.
- [x] Withdrawal-like symptoms and a higher likelihood of SIDS
    > The messaging stressed newborn withdrawal-like symptoms and elevated sudden infant death risk.

    > The divergence arose from allegiance, not recording flaws.
- [x] Construed reality shaped by group allegiance
    > Team loyalty led viewers to construe the same events differently.
- [ ] Genuine differences in how often each team broke rules

---

- [x] Recalling supportive anecdotes while forgetting contradictory cases
    > Selective memory for supportive details captures that phrase.
- [ ] Designing a study to falsify your current hypothesis
    > Seeking falsification is the opposite of selective recall.
- [ ] Ignoring any evidence until a peer replicates it
    > Waiting for replication is not selective memory for confirming details.

---
type: single
question: 16\. Why did the Gilliam et al. (2016) findings raise concern about disciplinary outcomes?
---

- [ ] They showed eye-tracking cannot capture teacher bias
    > The findings demonstrated bias, not measurement failure.
- [ ] They proved misbehaviour is entirely genetic
    > The study addressed attention biases, not genetics.
- [ ] They demonstrated that preschoolers cannot be objectively observed
    > The concern was biased monitoring, not impossibility of observation.
- [x] They suggested heightened monitoring could feed disproportionate punishment
    > Watching some children more can lead to catching and punishing them more often.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 18\. Using vivid warnings about infant health risks in anti-smoking messaging draws primarily on which persuasive strategy?
---

- [ ] A reciprocity norm asking for a small favour
    > The message is not invoking reciprocity.

type: single
question: 23\. Focusing on how people think about, influence, and relate to one another means social psychology is centrally concerned with...
---

- [ ] Molecular mechanisms within neurons
    > Neural mechanisms are not the central focus of social interaction here.

type: single
question: 25\. A health campaign that shows someone's behaviour is worse than the national average to motivate change is leveraging...
---

- [ ] Reinforcement schedules to shape operant behaviour
    > The tactic relies on comparison, not reward schedules.

```

```mcq
---
type: single

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 29\. When someone dismisses data challenging their view because it comes from a rival group, which bias is most evident?
---

    > Regression concerns data patterns, not motivated rejection of sources.
- [x] Motivated reasoning tied to identity
    > Rejecting evidence from an outgroup reflects identity-protective reasoning.
- [ ] Random sampling error only
    > The dismissal stems from motivation, not random error.
