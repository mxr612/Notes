type: single
question: 1\. According to Bohner and Dickel's definition, an attitude is best described as...
---

- [ ] A direct behavioural observation of an object
    > Observing behaviour is not itself an attitude.
- [ ] A reflexive motor response
    > Reflexes are automatic actions, not evaluative stances.
- [ ] A temporary mood state unrelated to objects
    > Attitudes are tied to objects of thought, not fleeting moods.
- [x] An evaluation of an object of thought
    > Bohner and Dickel define attitudes as evaluative responses toward objects.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 2\. The tripartite model (Beckler, 1984) separates attitudes into which components?
---

- [x] Behavioural, cognitive, affective
    > The model distinguishes behaviour tendencies, beliefs, and feelings.
- [ ] Behavioural, genetic, cultural
    > Genetics and culture are not the tripartite components.
- [ ] Biological, hormonal, neural
    > Physiological systems are outside this attitudinal model.
- [ ] Cognitive, perceptual, motor
    > Perceptual and motor pieces are not the classic trio.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 3\. Saying "I think going to the dentist is important" reflects which attitude component in the tripartite model?
---

- [ ] Behavioural
    > Behavioural components concern actions or intentions, not thoughts.
- [ ] Instrumental
    > Instrumental is a function, not a tripartite component.
- [ ] Affective
    > Affective deals with feelings, not this stated belief.
- [x] Cognitive
    > The statement is a belief about the dentist, reflecting cognition.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 4\. Katz's adaptive (instrumental) function of attitudes serves primarily to...
---

- [ ] Provide abstract explanations of the environment
    > Explaining the environment is the knowledge function, not adaptive.

    > The adaptive function guides behaviour toward rewards and away from costs.
- [ ] Express core identity and values
    > Expressing identity aligns with the value-expressive function.

    > Shielding self-esteem is ego-defensive, not adaptive.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 5\. The knowledge function of attitudes helps individuals to...
---

- [ ] Express belonging to a social group
    > Belonging expression is value-expressive, not knowledge-based.

    > Knowledge functions provide structure for interpreting and predicting events.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 6\. Which attitude function is emphasised when someone adopts a belief to fit their self-concept?
---

- [ ] Adaptive
    > Adaptive is about rewards and punishments, not self-concept expression.

    > Knowledge serves organisation, not identity alignment.
- [x] Value-expressive
    > Value-expressive attitudes communicate and align with one's identity and values.
- [ ] Ego-defensive

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 7\. Cognitive dissonance refers to the discomfort arising from...
---

- [ ] Excessive agreement between attitudes and behaviour
    > Concordance does not create dissonance.
- [x] A mismatch between thoughts and behaviour
    > Dissonance is the tension produced by inconsistency between cognitions and actions.
- [ ] A surplus of positive reinforcement
    > Reinforcement levels are unrelated to dissonance discomfort.
- [ ] Exposure to unfamiliar stimuli

question: 8\. Self-perception theory suggests that people infer their attitudes by...
---

- [ ] Reading authoritative texts
    > The theory focuses on observing one's own behaviour, not consulting texts.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 9\. Classical conditioning in attitude formation involves...
---

- [x] Pairing an object with positive or negative stimuli so it acquires that valence
    > Repeated pairing transfers the valence of the unconditioned stimulus to the object.
- [ ] Continuous punishment until behaviour changes
    > Punishment schedules are operant, not classical conditioning.
- [ ] Observing peers to learn vicariously
    > Vicarious learning is social learning, not classical conditioning.

    > Rewarding responses is operant, not classical conditioning.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 10\. Operant conditioning shapes attitudes by...
---

- [ ] Repeatedly exposing individuals to neutral stimuli
    > Mere exposure is separate from operant reinforcement.
- [ ] Presenting ambiguous information without feedback
    > Operant conditioning hinges on feedback, not ambiguity without consequences.
- [ ] Removing all consequences from choices
    > Without consequences, operant conditioning cannot occur.
- [x] Using reinforcement or punishment following behaviours toward an object
    > Consequences after behaviour alter attitudes via operant conditioning.
```

type: single
question: 11\. Mere exposure effects (Zajonc, 1968) show that repeated contact with a stimulus tends to...
---

- [ ] Have no impact on attitude formation
    > The effect shows repetition does change attitudes.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 13\. Imitating a regional accent leading to more positive attitudes toward that accent (Adank et al., 2013) is an example of...
---

type: single
question: 21\. Variable reinforcement in marketing (e.g., surprise rewards) aims to...
---

- [ ] Guarantee immediate attitude change without repetition
    > Variable rewards build engagement over time, not instant change.

---
type: single
question: 22\. The "that's-not-all" technique in marketing works by...
---

- [ ] Presenting an extreme request then retreating
    > That describes door-in-the-face, not this tactic.
- [ ] Hiding extra costs after agreement

- [x] Adding bonuses or reducing price to sweeten the deal before a decision
    > The seller improves the offer mid-pitch to encourage compliance.
- [ ] Starting with a small request and escalating it
    > That sequence is foot-in-the-door, not that's-not-all.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 23\. Low-ball techniques in advertising involve...
---

- [x] Offering a great deal, then revealing hidden costs after initial agreement
    > Low-balling secures commitment before disclosing added costs or constraints.
- [ ] Using peer testimony as the main tactic
    > Testimonials are a different persuasion cue.
- [ ] Avoiding any mention of price
    > The tactic hinges on price changes, not avoiding price.
- [ ] Providing extra bonuses at the start
    > Bonuses upfront are closer to that's-not-all, not low-ball.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 24\. The foot-in-the-door technique relies on...
---

- [x] A small agreed request followed by a related larger request
    > Securing a small commitment paves the way for a bigger one.
- [ ] A large initial request followed by a smaller one
    > That is door-in-the-face, not foot-in-the-door.
- [ ] A single, all-or-nothing demand
    > The technique uses two steps, not one.
- [ ] No prior interaction before the main request
    > The initial small request is essential.
```

---
type: single
question: 25\. Cognitive dissonance can motivate attitude change by prompting individuals to...
---

type: single
question: 28\. A value-expressive function of attitudes is evident when someone...
---

- [ ] Avoids threats to self-esteem
    > Avoidance of threat is ego-defensive.
- [ ] Uses rewards to shape behaviour
    > Rewards relate to the adaptive function.
- [x] Chooses a brand to signal identity alignment
    > Selecting a brand to express identity exemplifies value expression.
- [ ] Seeks information to predict outcomes

question: 29\. Ego-defensive functions of attitudes primarily help to...
---

- [x] Protect self-esteem from threat or anxiety
    > Ego-defensive attitudes buffer against threats to self-worth.
- [ ] Achieve instrumental rewards
    > Instrumental goals are adaptive, not ego-defensive.
- [ ] Provide cognitive structure for prediction
    > Structure for prediction is the knowledge function.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 30\. The overarching lesson from the attitudes lecture is that...
---

- [ ] Attitudes are fixed traits unaffected by experience
    > The lecture emphasised that attitudes can form and change.
- [x] Attitudes form and change through multiple routes, functions, and learning mechanisms
    > Multiple processes—from conditioning to elaboration—shape attitudes over time.
- [ ] Only conditioning, not cognition, shapes attitudes
    > Cognitive processes like elaboration and dissonance also drive change.
- [ ] Persuasion works only via source attractiveness
    > Source cues are just one peripheral factor among many mechanisms.
