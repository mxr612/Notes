type: single
question: 1\. West and Eaton's finding that most people rate themselves as less prejudiced than others illustrates which bias?
---

- [ ] Belief in a just world
    > This bias concerns fairness beliefs, not self-rating of prejudice.
- [ ] Illusory superiority about intelligence
    > The self-enhancement reported was about prejudice, not intelligence.
- [ ] Fundamental attribution error
    > Attribution errors differ from self-evaluations of bias.
- [x] Self-enhancement in judging one's own bias
    > People enhanced their self-image by claiming to be less prejudiced than others.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 2\. Prejudice is defined here as a...
---

- [x] Negative feeling toward a member of a group because of group membership
    > Prejudice is affective negativity directed at someone due to group status.
- [ ] Behavioural act directed toward a group member
    > Behavioural acts fall under discrimination.
- [ ] Overgeneralised belief about a group
    > Overgeneralised beliefs are stereotypes.
- [ ] Policy that enforces equality across groups
    > Policies are structural, not the feeling-based prejudice described.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 3\. Stereotypes are best described as...
---

- [ ] A behaviour that harms group members
    > Behaviour describes discrimination, not stereotypes.
- [ ] A sudden emotional reaction to group symbols
    > Emotional reactions reflect prejudice.
- [x] A fixed, overgeneralised belief about a group
    > Stereotypes are simplified, generalised beliefs about group members.
- [ ] Any law that segregates groups
    > Laws are not the cognitive beliefs termed stereotypes.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 4\. Discrimination refers to...
---

- [ ] A cognitive schema that guides perception
    > Schemas describe stereotypes, not discriminatory behaviour.
- [ ] A positive evaluation of outgroups
    > Discrimination is negative and behavioural.
- [ ] A neutral categorisation process without affect
    > Discrimination entails harmful treatment, not neutral sorting.
- [x] Actual behaviour with negative impact on a group
    > Discrimination is behaviour that disadvantages people because of group membership.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 5\. The "Draw a Scientist" task is used to reveal...
---

- [ ] People's ability to render accurate portraits
    > The task probes mental images, not artistic accuracy.
- [ ] Explicit rejection of science careers
    > It uncovers stereotypes, not career refusal.
- [x] Implicit stereotypes about who counts as a scientist
    > Drawings expose default images about scientists' gender or appearance.
- [ ] Memory for famous scientists' faces
    > The task is not a memory test of individuals.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 6\. A key limitation of explicit attitude measures noted in the slides was that respondents...
---

- [ ] Perfectly predict behaviour
    > Explicit scores do not perfectly forecast behaviour.
- [ ] Avoid any social desirability concerns
    > Respondents often manage impressions on explicit scales.
- [ ] Cannot complete them online
    > Online administration is not the major limitation.
- [x] May give socially desirable answers
    > Social desirability can distort explicit self-reports.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 7\. Reactivity in explicit measures refers to...
---

- [ ] Participants changing answers after debrief
    > Reactivity concerns responses during measurement, not after debrief.
- [ ] Measurement only of implicit processes
    > Explicit measures capture conscious reports, not implicit processes.
- [ ] The effect of time limits on memory tests
    > Time limits are unrelated to explicit attitude reactivity.
- [x] Instability when people generate attitudes on the spot
    > Answers can shift because respondents construct attitudes while responding.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 8\. Implicit attitudes are described as biases that...
---

- [ ] Are fully under conscious control
    > They operate automatically outside full awareness.

---
type: single
question: 9\. Traditional discrimination was defined as bias that is...
---

- [ ] Entirely unconscious and unintentional
    > Traditional discrimination was overt and intentional.

---

- [x] Subtle, often unintentional bias from people who see themselves as fair-minded
    > Individuals who endorse equality can still act in subtly biased ways.
- [ ] Open hostility and explicit slurs
    > Open hostility fits traditional, not aversive, discrimination.
- [ ] Legal policies mandating segregation
    > Policies of segregation are explicit, not aversive, discrimination.

---
type: single
question: 11\. A microassault is...
---

- [ ] A subtle communication that negates someone's experience
    > That describes microinvalidations, not microassaults.
- [ ] Unconscious bias revealed only by reaction time
    > Microassaults are deliberate, not unconscious.
- [x] A deliberate slur or action meant to hurt the target

    > They are harmful, not neutral.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 12\. A microinsult involves...
---

- [x] Verbal or nonverbal cues that subtly demean someone's identity
    > Microinsults are subtle put-downs that convey demeaning messages.
- [ ] Overt physical aggression
    > Physical aggression would be more blatant than a microinsult.
- [ ] Explicit agreement with equality norms
    > Agreement with equality is not insulting.
- [ ] Complete avoidance of a group member

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 13\. A microinvalidation occurs when a communication...
---

- [ ] Affirms the target's experience as valid
    > Microinvalidations dismiss, not affirm, experiences.
- [x] Excludes or nullifies the reality of a minority person's experience
    > They negate or undermine the lived experience of the target.
- [ ] Provides positive feedback about performance
    > Positive feedback does not invalidate experiences.
- [ ] Uses data to counter stereotypes

type: single
question: 14\. System 1 thinking (Kahneman, 2011) is characterised as...
---

- [x] Automatic, fast, and outside awareness
    > System 1 operates quickly and unconsciously.
- [ ] Dependent on formal instruction
    > System 1 does not require instruction; it is intuitive.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 16\. Explicit attitudes are generated primarily by...
---

- [ ] Reflexive motor responses
    > Reflexes are System 1, not the basis of explicit attitudes.
- [ ] Random guessing
    > Explicit attitudes involve deliberate endorsement.
- [ ] System 1 processes only
    > They are tied to reflective System 2 thinking.
- [x] System 2 deliberate processing
    > Conscious, effortful thought underpins explicit attitudes.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 17\. Implicit attitudes are linked to...

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 18\. One reason for an attitude-behaviour gap is that...
---

- [ ] People never want to present themselves favourably
    > Impression management often pushes people to present favourably.
- [x] Attitudes may be hidden or inaccessible to introspection
    > Implicit or inaccessible attitudes can prevent direct translation into behaviour.
- [ ] Behaviour always perfectly matches self-reports
    > Behaviour frequently diverges from stated attitudes.
- [ ] Social norms do not affect disclosure
    > Norms do affect what people disclose.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 19\. The slides argue that measuring only explicit attitudes is insufficient because...
---

- [x] Social desirability and lack of awareness can hide true attitudes
    > Explicit measures miss hidden or masked biases.
- [ ] People cannot understand any questions
    > Comprehension is not the main issue.
- [ ] Explicit reports never change over time
    > Explicit attitudes can change; the problem is partial visibility.
- [ ] Implicit biases never influence behaviour
    > Implicit biases do influence behaviour, so measuring only explicit misses key drivers.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 20\. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is based on the idea that people are faster when...
---

- [ ] Sorting categories unrelated to valence
    > Speed differences arise when categories align with existing associations.
- [ ] Guessing randomly under time pressure
    > Random guessing is not the mechanism behind IAT effects.
- [x] Sorting pairings consistent with their associations
    > Congruent pairings are sorted faster because they match automatic associations.
- [ ] Asked to avoid using one response key
    > Key use is dictated by the task, not by avoidance.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 21\. The IAT was first developed to measure...
---

- [x] Racial preferences between White and Black Americans
    > The original IAT assessed automatic preferences between Black and White categories.
- [ ] Brand preferences in consumer behaviour
    > Consumer IATs came later.
- [ ] Memory for neutral words
    > The test measures associative strength, not simple memory.
- [ ] Visual search speed for shapes
    > Visual search tasks are different from the IAT.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 22\. According to Kim (2003), lay people...
---

- [ ] Can easily fake the IAT without instruction
    > Without training, faking is difficult.
- [ ] Always show zero bias on the IAT
    > Biases are often detected rather than absent.
- [ ] Never understand how the IAT works
    > Understanding varies; the finding concerned faking ability.
- [x] Cannot fake the IAT without detailed instructions
    > Kim showed that faking requires specific guidance beyond lay knowledge.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 23\. In the Shooter Task, higher implicit weapon bias toward Black targets predicted...
---

- [ ] Slower decisions to shoot Black suspects
    > Bias led to quicker, not slower, shoot decisions.
- [x] Faster decisions to shoot Black suspects
    > Stronger implicit weapon associations sped shooting responses toward Black targets.
- [ ] No difference in response speed
    > Bias produced measurable speed differences.
- [ ] More accurate identification of non-weapons only
    > The bias affected shooting speed rather than only accuracy for non-weapons.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 24\. A correspondence study tests discrimination by...
---

- [ ] Comparing real-world arrest rates between groups
    > Arrest comparisons do not involve controlled applications.
- [ ] Having interviewers rate videos without CVs
    > Videos without CVs do not test callback discrimination.
- [x] Sending matched CVs that differ only on group cues and tracking call-backs
    > Correspondence studies vary only group identifiers on equivalent CVs to detect bias.
- [ ] Surveying applicant self-esteem before interviews
    > Self-esteem surveys do not reveal hiring discrimination.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 25\. Di Stasio and Heath (2021) found that applicants with Black African, Black Caribbean, or Muslim names had to send about...
---

- [ ] The same number of CVs as British-sounding names
    > They faced higher effort than applicants with British-sounding names.
- [ ] 17% more CVs than British-sounding names
    > The gap was much larger than 17%.
- [ ] 23% more CVs than British-sounding names
    > The reported figure exceeded 23%.
- [x] 93% more CVs than British-sounding names
    > These applicants needed roughly 93% more CVs to get callbacks.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 26\. In Rooth's study, explicit attitude scales toward Muslims versus Swedes showed...
---

- [x] No explicit bias, while IAT scores predicted hiring likelihood
    > Explicit reports were neutral, but implicit scores related to hiring decisions.
- [ ] Strong explicit bias against Muslim-sounding names
    > Explicit measures did not show strong bias.
- [ ] Bias only when names were paired with photos
    > The result concerned implicit measures, not photo pairing.
- [ ] Perfect agreement with IAT scores for all recruiters
    > Explicit and implicit measures diverged rather than perfectly matched.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 27\. In video interviews, a messy background leading to lower competence ratings is an example of the...
---

- [ ] Halo effect
    > A messy background is a negative cue causing a negative overall judgment, fitting a horn effect.
- [x] Horn effect
    > One negative cue (messy background) pulls overall evaluations downward.
- [ ] Confirmation bias
    > This is not about seeking confirming evidence.
- [ ] Mere exposure effect
    > Repetition is not the driver; the single cue shapes impressions.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 28\. The halo effect occurs when...
---

- [ ] One negative cue drives overall negative judgement
    > That is the horn effect, not halo.
- [x] A single positive cue boosts overall evaluation
    > A standout positive feature colours the entire impression in a halo effect.
- [ ] No cues are available, so judgement is random
    > The effect relies on salient cues, not cue absence.
- [ ] Interviewers rely solely on CV content
    > Halo effects arise from peripheral cues, not exclusive CV review.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 29\. Implicit biases, according to the workshop, tend to...
---

- [x] Shift slowly with sustained exposure and interventions
    > They are malleable but change gradually with continued effort.
- [ ] Disappear immediately after a single warning
    > One warning rarely erases implicit bias.
- [ ] Increase only in laboratory contexts
    > Implicit biases operate beyond the lab.
- [ ] Remain unchanged regardless of input
    > They can change, though not rapidly.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 30\. Overall, reducing discriminatory behaviour requires...
---

- [ ] Focusing only on explicit attitudes
    > Addressing explicit bias alone misses implicit drivers.
- [ ] Treating biases as fixed and unchangeable
    > Biases can be mitigated with effort.
- [ ] Ignoring contextual cues like names or backgrounds
    > Contextual cues need to be managed to curb bias.
- [x] Addressing both implicit and explicit processes and situational cues
    > Effective reduction tackles implicit and explicit biases along with contextual triggers.
