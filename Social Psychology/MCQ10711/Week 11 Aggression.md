```mcq

type: single
question: 1\. Baron & Richardson (1994) define aggression as behaviour intended to harm a living being who...
---

- [ ] Requests the treatment
    > Aggression assumes the target wants to avoid the treatment, not request it.
- [ ] Cannot perceive the harm
    > Awareness is not part of the definition; intent to harm is key.
- [ ] Benefits from the behaviour
    > Harmful intent means the behaviour is not for the target's benefit.
- [x] Is motivated to avoid such treatment
    > Aggression targets someone motivated to avoid the harm.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 2\. A shot fired that misses the target is still aggression because...
---

- [ ] Harm was accidental
    > The intent to harm makes it aggression even if harm fails.
- [ ] The target asked for it
    > The target did not solicit harm.
- [x] There was intent to harm even without injury
    > Aggression hinges on intent, not successful injury.
- [ ] It caused no pain
    > Pain absence does not remove aggressive intent.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 3\. Pain caused by a dentist is not classified as aggression in the lecture because...
---

- [ ] The target wants to avoid pain
    > Patients consent to treatment despite discomfort.
- [ ] It is psychological, not physical
    > Dental work can be physical; the key is intent.
- [x] Intent to harm is absent; harm is accidental
    > The dentist's goal is treatment, not harm, so it is not aggression.
- [ ] The dentist lacks awareness of harm
    > Dentists know pain may occur but do not aim to harm.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 4\. Violence differs from aggression in that violence...
---

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 5\. Hostile aggression is primarily motivated by...
---

- [x] Expressing anger and harming the target
    > Hostile aggression is driven by anger with harm as the goal.

    > Using harm instrumentally describes instrumental aggression.
- [ ] Financial gain only
    > Financial motives fit instrumental aggression, not hostile aggression.
- [ ] Avoiding all confrontation
    > Hostile aggression confronts rather than avoids.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 6\. Instrumental aggression refers to behaviour where harm is...
---

- [x] A side effect in pursuit of another goal
    > Harm serves as a means to another end in instrumental aggression.
- [ ] The main goal
    > Harm as the goal defines hostile aggression.
- [ ] Unintended and unrelated to goals
    > Instrumental aggression involves intentional harm linked to goals.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 7\. Laboratory aggression paradigms often use aversive stimuli such as...
---

- [x] Electric shocks, loud noise, hot sauce, or ice water
    > Lab paradigms employ mild aversive stimuli like shocks, noise, hot sauce, or cold pressor tasks.
- [ ] Friendly text messages
    > Friendly messages are not aversive measures of aggression.
- [ ] Monetary rewards
    > Rewards are positive, not aggression measures.
- [ ] Compliments
    > Compliments do not index aggression.

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 8\. A key limitation of lab aggression measures is...
---

- [ ] They lack any validation
    > Measures have construct validation despite limits.
- [ ] They allow severe injury

- [ ] They cannot be replicated
    > Paradigms are replicable despite mildness.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 9\. Archival measures of aggression can include...
---

- [ ] Only lab questionnaires
    > Archival data go beyond questionnaires.
- [x] Crime statistics like intimate partner violence or murder rates
    > Archival indices often use crime and violence statistics.
- [ ] Heart-rate monitors
    > Physiological measures are not archival crime data.

    > Handedness is unrelated to aggression archives.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 10\. Frustration-aggression hypothesis originally claimed that...
---

- [ ] Frustration never leads to aggression
    > The original claim linked frustration to aggression.
- [x] All frustration leads to aggression and all aggression comes from frustration
    > The classic hypothesis was a one-to-one mapping between frustration and aggression.

    > Catharsis was not the central claim of the hypothesis.

    > Leftover arousal can be misattributed, amplifying aggression.
- [ ] Eliminate the need for cognitive labels
    > Cognitive labelling is still involved in attribution.
- [ ] Prevent aggression entirely
    > Arousal can heighten aggression rather than prevent it.
```
