question: 1\. Social influence in this lecture refers to which broad process?
---

- [ ] Genetic drift leading to behavioural change over generations
    > Genetic drift is evolutionary, not the immediate social influence discussed.
- [x] Individuals changing behaviour because of real or implied influence from others
    > Social influence here means behaviour shifts prompted by others' actual or implied presence.
- [ ] Behaviour shifts driven only by internal mood states
    > Private mood shifts lack the external social source highlighted in the lecture.
- [ ] Economic forces determining all social choices
    > Economic trends are not the interpersonal influence process being defined.

question: 2\. Compliance was described as the target of influence doing what?
---

- [x] Acquiescing to a request without necessarily changing true attitudes
    > Compliance is outward agreement to a request without requiring private attitude change.
- [ ] Rejecting requests while changing private attitudes
    > Rejecting requests is the opposite of compliance.
- [ ] Experiencing deep internalisation of group norms
    > Internalisation involves private acceptance, not just acquiescence.
- [ ] Reversing previously held beliefs permanently
    > Compliance need not alter underlying beliefs at all.

question: 3\. The door-in-the-face technique involves which sequence?
---

- [ ] Presenting a small request first, followed by a related larger request
    > That sequence describes foot-in-the-door, not door-in-the-face.
- [ ] Providing a reward before any request is made
    > Rewards are not the defining feature of this technique.
- [ ] Offering no request until the target initiates contact
    > Door-in-the-face begins with an initial ask from the influencer.
- [x] Making an extreme request that is refused, then retreating to a moderate request
    > It relies on a large initial request then a concession to a smaller one to gain compliance.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 4\. The foot-in-the-door technique works primarily because people strive for...
---

- [ ] Variety in their daily decisions
    > The effect is not about seeking variety.
- [ ] Avoiding all social interactions
    > It depends on engagement, not avoidance.
- [ ] Maximising immediate personal gain regardless of promises
    > The driver is not short-term gain but self-consistency.
- [x] Consistency after agreeing to an initial small request
    > Having agreed once, people feel pressure to act consistently on a larger request.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 5\. Low-balling succeeds by first obtaining compliance and then...
---

- [x] Increasing the cost while counting on the target to feel committed
    > Once committed, people accept added costs to stay consistent with their initial agreement.
- [ ] Substituting an unrelated favour after agreement
    > Low-balling changes the terms of the same request, not a new favour.
- [ ] Lowering the cost to keep the target satisfied
    > Costs are raised, not lowered.
- [ ] Removing any obligation after the first agreement
    > The tactic relies on maintaining obligation, not removing it.
```

question: 6\. Majority influence typically leads to which outcome compared with minority influence?
---

- [x] Public compliance through normative pressure
    > Majorities often create normative pressure that yields public compliance.
- [ ] Private conversion based on careful validation
    > Private conversion is more associated with minority influence.
- [ ] Rejection of group norms in favour of innovation
    > Majority influence pushes conformity, not rejection of norms.
- [ ] Equal reliance on informational cues from both sides
    > Majority impact is usually stronger and normative rather than evenly informational.
```

question: 7\. In Asch's original line judgement study, participants publicly gave the incorrect majority answer on roughly what proportion of trials?
---

- [ ] 5 percent of trials
    > Conformity rates were far higher than 5 percent.
- [x] 36.8 percent of trials
    > Asch reported errors on about 36.8 percent of critical trials.
- [ ] 12.5 percent of trials
    > This lower rate matched a variation with private responses, not the original public setting.
- [ ] 82.5 percent of trials
    > Conformity never approached this extreme level.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 8\. When Asch allowed participants to write answers privately while confederates spoke aloud, conformity dropped to about...
---

- [ ] 0.7 percent
    > Conformity did not fall to near zero.
- [x] 12.5 percent
    > Private responding reduced conformity to roughly 12.5 percent.
- [ ] 36.8 percent
    > 36.8 percent reflected the public response condition.
- [ ] 82.5 percent
    > No variation produced this level of conformity.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 9\. The autokinetic effect study by Sherif (1936) primarily demonstrated conformity in what context?
---

- [ ] Clear, unambiguous stimuli where accuracy is certain
    > The task was ambiguous, not clear-cut.
- [ ] Motor tasks requiring physical coordination
    > It involved visual estimates, not coordinated movement.
- [ ] Tasks with no visual component and no interaction
    > Participants observed a visual illusion and interacted with group estimates.
- [x] Ambiguous stimuli where group discussion shapes perceived reality
    > In ambiguity, group norms formed and influenced judgments of dot movement.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 10\. Normative social influence, per Deutsch and Gerard (1955), is best described as...
---

- [ ] Going along with others because their information seems more accurate
    > That is informational influence, not normative.
- [ ] Avoiding all group input to preserve independence
    > Normative influence involves engaging with the group, not avoiding it.
- [ ] Basing choices on statistical models alone
    > Normative pressure is about social approval, not statistics.
- [x] Going along to gain approval or avoid rejection from the group
    > Normative influence stems from the desire for social acceptance.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 11\. Informational social influence involves...
---

- [ ] Public compliance without changing private views
    > Informational influence often alters private beliefs, not just public acts.
- [ ] Assuming the majority must be wrong because of conformity
    > It assumes others may be correct, not automatically wrong.
- [x] Accepting others' evidence as a guide when uncertain about accuracy
    > People use others' input as information when they doubt their own judgment.
- [ ] Rejecting any external input when making judgments
    > Rejecting outside input would block informational influence.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 12\. Automatic mimicry, mentioned under conformity, refers to...
---

- [ ] Conscious attempts to mirror others for strategic gain
    > Automatic mimicry happens without conscious intent.
- [x] Unconscious copying of others' behaviours without awareness
    > People subtly imitate others' gestures or posture outside awareness.
- [ ] Deliberate training to imitate expert performers
    > Training is intentional, unlike automatic mimicry.
- [ ] A refusal to adjust behaviour in social settings
    > The phenomenon is adjustment, not refusal.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 13\. The key distinction between compliance and internalisation in the slides was that compliance...
---

- [ ] Is deep and private
    > Depth and privacy describe internalisation, not compliance.
- [ ] Involves both behaviour and belief change
    > Compliance changes behaviour without necessarily shifting beliefs.
- [x] Is superficial and public
    > Compliance is outward conformity without guaranteed private acceptance.
- [ ] Requires complete agreement with majority values
    > Compliance can occur even without genuine agreement.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 14\. A student changes their answer to match the group in public but reverts to their original answer in private. This illustrates...
---

- [ ] Internalisation
    > Private disagreement indicates no internalisation.
- [ ] Minority validation
    > The change follows the majority, not a minority.
- [ ] Informational influence based on evidence
    > The shift is to fit in, not because of better evidence.
- [x] Compliance driven by normative pressure
    > Public conformity with private reversal shows normative compliance.

question: 15\. Moscovici's blue-green slide study showed that a consistent minority...
---

- [ ] Produced virtually no change compared with control
    > The consistent minority produced some shift.
- [ ] Eliminated majority influence entirely
    > Majority influence remained; it was not eliminated.
- [x] Could shift a small proportion of majority responses
    > Consistency led some participants to adopt the minority label on a few trials.
- [ ] Required unanimous support from the whole group to matter
    > The minority influenced without unanimity from the full group.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 16\. Compared to majority influence, the slides linked minority influence with...
---

- [ ] Short-term public compliance
    > Minority influence tends toward deeper change, not fleeting compliance.
- [ ] Normative pressure to avoid rejection
    > It works more through validation than normative pressure.
- [x] Private conversion and longer-lasting change
    > Minority messages can prompt internal reconsideration and lasting shifts.
- [ ] Absence of any informational content
    > Minority influence often provides alternative information to consider.

question: 17\. Milgram's (1963) baseline obedience setup used which cover story?
---

- [ ] Testing moral development across ages
    > Participants were told the study concerned learning, not moral development.
- [ ] Evaluating negotiation tactics under stress
    > Negotiation was not part of the cover story.
- [ ] Measuring teamwork in group puzzles
    > The setup was an individual teacher-learner task, not group puzzles.

question: 18\. In Milgram's standard procedure, what happened to shock level after each learner mistake?
---

- [ ] It decreased by 15 volts
    > Shocks escalated, they were not reduced.
- [ ] It remained at the same level
    > Participants were instructed to increase the level after errors.
- [x] It increased in 15-volt increments
    > The protocol stepped shocks up by 15 volts after each mistake.
- [ ] It jumped randomly between levels
    > Shock increases followed an ordered progression, not random jumps.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 19\. Which prompt was part of the standardised prods used by Milgram's experimenter?
---

- [ ] "You may stop now if you feel uncomfortable"
    > Prods urged continuation, not permission to stop.
- [x] "The experiment requires that you continue"
    > This was one of the scripted prompts to keep participants going.
- [ ] "The learner has requested a break"
    > The experimenter did not cite learner requests in the prods.
- [ ] "You are free to choose any voltage"
    > Participants were told to follow the sequence, not choose freely.
```

    > Obedience was much higher than 12.5 percent in this variation.
- [ ] 36.8 percent
    > The rate exceeded this level.
- [ ] 70.0 percent
    > Obedience climbed even higher than seventy percent.
- [x] 92.5 percent

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 22\. In a variation where participants chose the shock level freely, most participants...
---

- [x] Stayed below 150 volts
    > When free to choose, participants typically selected only mild shocks below 150 volts.
- [ ] Went to 300 volts but not higher
    > They generally stopped well before 300 volts.
- [ ] Went immediately to 450 volts
    > None jumped straight to the maximum when given free choice.
- [ ] Refused to administer any shock
    > Most did administer shocks, though at low levels.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 23\. Milgram's concept of an agentic shift involves people...
---

- [ ] Remaining in an autonomous state regardless of orders
    > The agentic shift describes leaving the autonomous state, not staying in it.
- [ ] Taking full personal responsibility for all actions
    > In the agentic state, responsibility is displaced, not fully owned.
- [x] Shifting responsibility to an authority and seeing themselves as executing orders
    > People view themselves as agents carrying out the authority's wishes.
- [ ] Rejecting authority due to personal values

type: single
question: 24\. Burger's (2009) replication introduced which key ethical safeguard?
---

- [ ] No deception at any stage of the study
    > Burger still used a cover story, so deception remained.
- [ ] Removal of all prods to reduce pressure
    > Standardised prods were still included.
- [x] A voltage cap at 150 volts with immediate debrief
    > Participants were stopped at 150 volts and promptly debriefed to protect welfare.
- [ ] Allowing only anonymous online participation

type: single
question: 26\. Hofling et al. (1966) found that nurses asked to administer an excessive drug dose mostly...
---

- [ ] Refused immediately and reported the caller
    > Most nurses did not refuse outright.
- [ ] Sought written orders before acting
    > Few paused for written confirmation.
- [x] Prepared to comply until stopped by the researchers
    > Many nurses moved toward administering the dose until the study was halted.
- [ ] Administered only half the requested dose
    > They did not simply halve the dose; they proceeded until interrupted.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 27\. Binding factors in Milgram's interpretation refer to...
---

- [ ] Genetic predispositions toward obedience
    > Binding factors are situational and psychological, not genetic.
- [x] Psychological barriers that make disobedience feel difficult
    > Commitments, politeness, and fear of disrupting the study bind participants to continue.
- [ ] The physical restraints used on participants
    > Participants were not physically restrained.
- [ ] Legal contracts signed before the study
    > No legal contracts compelled continuation; the binding was psychological.
```

```mcq

type: single
question: 28\. Normative influence is most likely when someone conforms to...
---

- [x] Avoid social disapproval from the group
    > Seeking acceptance or avoiding rejection triggers normative conformity.
- [ ] Gain accurate information in an ambiguous task
    > That motive reflects informational influence.
- [ ] Reduce cognitive effort in simple tasks
    > Normative pressure is about social evaluation, not mental effort.
- [ ] Express independence from peers
    > Expressing independence runs counter to conforming for approval.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 29\. Informational influence is especially strong when...
---

- [ ] The correct answer is obvious and uncontested
    > In clear tasks, people rely on themselves rather than others' information.
- [ ] People want to avoid any change in belief
    > Openness to change is what drives informational use of others' input.
- [ ] Social approval is the primary goal
    > Seeking approval is normative, not informational.
- [x] The task is ambiguous and others are perceived as knowledgeable
    > Uncertainty plus respect for others' expertise heightens informational influence.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 30\. The overall lesson from the conformity and obedience material was that...
---

- [ ] Social influence processes are weak outside the lab
    > Real-world studies show strong influence beyond laboratory walls.
- [x] Contextual cues and authority structures can strongly shape behaviour
    > Situations and authority dramatically affect conformity and obedience.
- [ ] Only personality traits determine whether people comply
    > Situational factors, not just traits, drive outcomes.
- [ ] Group pressure has no impact when stakes are high
    > High stakes can still leave people vulnerable to group and authority pressure.
