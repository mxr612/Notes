question: 1\. West and Eaton's (2019) finding that most people rate themselves as less prejudiced than others illustrates which bias?
---

- [ ] Belief in a just world
    > Belief in a just world concerns fairness perceptions, not self-rating of bias.
- [ ] Illusory superiority about intelligence
    > The self-enhancement shown is about prejudice, not intelligence.
- [ ] Fundamental attribution error
    > FAE is about attributions, not self-judgment of prejudice.
- [x] Self-enhancement in judging one's own bias
    > Rating oneself as less biased than others reflects self-enhancing social comparisons.
```

question: 2\. Prejudice is defined in the slides as a(n)...
---

- [x] Negative feeling toward a member of a group because of group membership
    > Prejudice refers to negative affect directed at people based on their group.

type: single
question: 4\. Discrimination was defined as...
---

- [ ] A cognitive schema that guides perception
    > Schemas and perceptions refer to stereotypes, not discrimination.
- [ ] A positive evaluation of outgroups
    > Discrimination denotes negative behaviour, not positive evaluation.

type: single
question: 5\. The "Draw a Scientist" task is used in lecture to reveal...
---

- [ ] People's ability to render accurate portraits
    > The task is diagnostic of concepts, not artistic skill.
- [ ] Explicit rejection of science careers
    > It probes mental images, not career rejection.
- [x] Implicit stereotypes about who counts as a scientist
    > Children's drawings expose stereotyped images of scientists' gender or appearance.
- [ ] Memory for famous scientists' faces
    > The task is not a memory test for individuals.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 6\. A key limitation of explicit attitude measures noted in the slides was...
---

- [ ] They perfectly predict behaviour
    > Explicit reports often diverge from behaviour.
- [ ] They avoid any social desirability concerns
    > Respondents manage impressions on explicit measures.
- [ ] They cannot be administered online
    > Administration mode is not the primary limitation discussed.
- [x] Respondents may give socially desirable answers
    > Social desirability pressures make explicit reports unreliable.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 7\. Reactivity in explicit measures refers to...
---

- [ ] Participants changing answers after debrief
    > Reactivity concerns online responding, not post-debrief changes.
- [ ] Measurement only of implicit processes
    > Explicit measures capture self-report, not implicit processes.
- [ ] The effect of time limits on memory tests
    > Time limits are unrelated to attitude reactivity.
- [x] Instability when people generate attitudes on the spot
    > Forming attitudes during questioning can make responses reactive and unstable.
```

type: single
question: 9\. The Clark and Clark (1947) doll study showed that many Black children...
---

- [ ] Preferred to play with dolls matching their own skin tone
    > Many chose the White doll, not one matching themselves.
- [ ] Randomly selected dolls with no pattern
    > Choices showed a pattern rather than randomness.
- [x] Showed preferences indicating internalised negative stereotypes
    > Selecting the White doll reflected internalised bias about worth and goodness.
- [ ] Refused to choose between dolls

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 10\. The findings from Clark and Clark (1947) highlight the importance of...
---

- [x] Positive representation to counter internalised bias
    > The study underscored how representation shapes self-perception and the need for positive images.

type: single
question: 11\. Illusory correlation, as presented in the slides, involves...
---

- [ ] Underestimating the co-occurrence of two common events
    > The effect inflates, not underestimates, certain co-occurrences.
- [x] Believing two rare events co-occur more often than they do
    > Distinctive pairings of rare events seem more frequent than they are.
- [ ] Seeing patterns only when data are presented numerically
    > Illusory correlations arise in everyday impressions, not just numeric data.
- [ ] Forgetting rare negative events entirely

type: single
question: 12\. In Hamilton and Gifford's account, which pair is especially memorable and overestimated?
---

- [ ] Majority members performing positive behaviours
    > Common positive behaviours by majorities do not stand out.
- [ ] Majority members performing negative behaviours
    > Majority negatives are less distinctive.
- [x] Minority members performing negative behaviours
    > Rare negative acts by minorities are distinctive and overestimated.
- [ ] Minority members performing neutral behaviours
    > Neutral actions are not the distinctive pair that drives the illusion.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 13\. The illusory correlation effect can lead people to...
---

- [x] Assume minority groups commit disproportionate negative acts
    > Overestimating minority negatives feeds biased conclusions about wrongdoing.
- [ ] Ignore negative behaviours entirely
    > The bias exaggerates, not ignores, negatives.
- [ ] Treat all group members as interchangeable in positive ways
    > The illusion highlights negative distinctiveness, not positive interchangeability.
- [ ] Believe common events are rare
    > It overestimates rare pairings rather than deeming common events rare.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 14\. A stereotype threat manipulation typically affects performance because...
---

- [ ] Individuals receive more resources to succeed
    > Threat manipulations add pressure, not resources.

question: 15\. The workshop's media examples (e.g., tabloid covers) illustrate how...
---

- [x] Repeated negative imagery can reinforce stereotypes
    > Saturating media with negative depictions strengthens stereotyped associations.

    > Explicit measures ask people to state their evaluations.
- [ ] Reaction-time tasks exclusively
    > Reaction-time tasks tap implicit, not explicit, attitudes.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 18\. One limitation of wording effects in explicit measures is that...
---

- [x] Item phrasing can shift responses without changing true attitudes
    > Small wording tweaks can alter reported attitudes even if underlying views stay the same.
- [ ] All respondents interpret items identically
    > Wording differences lead to varied interpretations.
- [ ] Negative wording always reduces prejudice scores
    > Negative wording does not uniformly lower scores.
- [ ] Wording never matters if instructions are clear
    > Clear instructions do not eliminate wording effects.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 19\. Implicit stereotypes can persist even when...
---

- [ ] Groups are numerically equal in all contexts
    > Equal numbers do not automatically erase implicit stereotypes.
- [ ] Social desirability is low
    > Implicit bias can operate regardless of social desirability pressures.
- [ ] Individuals have never been exposed to media
    > Exposure often occurs; the point is that implicit biases persist even when explicit beliefs are egalitarian.
- [x] People consciously endorse egalitarian beliefs
    > Implicit stereotypes can endure despite explicit commitments to equality.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 20\. Positive representation (e.g., diverse scientists or princesses) matters because...
---

- [ ] It removes the need for any further interventions
    > Representation helps but does not make other efforts unnecessary.
- [ ] It guarantees immediate policy change
    > Policy change is not automatic from representation alone.
- [x] It can broaden prototypes and counteract internalised bias
    > Showing diverse exemplars widens prototypes and challenges internalised stereotypes.
- [ ] It ensures all media become stereotype-free
    > Media can still contain stereotypes even with some positive examples.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 21\. The draw-a-scientist task over decades shows that science-gender stereotypes are...

---
type: single
question: 22\. Social desirability in attitude reporting leads to...

- [ ] Accurate reporting regardless of topic
    > Social desirability distorts accuracy on sensitive topics.
- [ ] Random responding to all items
    > Responses are biased, not random.
- [x] Underreporting socially sensitive biases
    > Desire to appear unbiased can suppress honest admission of prejudice.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 23\. When people believe they are less biased than others, a likely consequence is...
---

- [x] Reduced motivation to address their own prejudices
    > Seeing oneself as less biased can lower motivation to change.

    > Feeling already unbiased discourages vigilance.
- [ ] More accurate self-assessment over time
    > Self-enhancement does not improve accuracy.
- [ ] Immediate elimination of implicit attitudes
    > Implicit attitudes persist despite self-perceptions of low bias.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 24\. Media narratives that associate minority status with crime exemplify...
---

- [ ] Bilateral argument framing
    > These narratives are not balanced arguments.
- [x] Illusory correlation reinforcement
    > Highlighting rare negative acts by minorities strengthens illusory correlations between group and crime.
- [ ] Value-expressive attitude functions
    > The issue is biased pairing, not identity expression.

    > Such narratives create, not remove, stereotype threat contexts.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 25\. According to the slides, discrimination corresponds most closely to which component of the ABC model?
---

- [ ] Affective
    > Affective corresponds to prejudice, not discrimination.
- [x] Behavioural
    > Discrimination is the behavioural component of bias.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 26\. Affective prejudice can exist even when...
---

- [x] Behavioural discrimination is absent
    > People may feel prejudice without acting on it.
- [ ] No stereotypes are present
    > Prejudice often coexists with stereotypes.
- [ ] Group categories are unknown
    > Without categories, prejudice cannot be targeted.

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 27\. Which statement about implicit attitudes is accurate per the lecture?
---

- [ ] They never align with explicit attitudes
    > Sometimes implicit and explicit attitudes do align.
- [ ] They always determine overt behaviour
    > Behaviour is shaped by many factors beyond implicit attitudes.
- [x] They can guide behaviour even without conscious endorsement

```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 28\. The workshop emphasised that implicit attitudes...
---

- [ ] Are impossible to change
    > They are malleable, though slowly.
- [x] Can shift slowly with sustained exposure and interventions
    > Change is possible over time through repeated counter-stereotypic input.
- [ ] Are best addressed by ignoring them
    > Ignoring them leaves biases unchallenged.
- [ ] Shift quickly after a single message
    > Single exposures rarely create lasting implicit change.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 29\. A person thinking "most people from that minority group commit crimes" after hearing about a single case is demonstrating...
---

- [ ] Fundamental attribution error only
    > This reaction stems from biased frequency estimation, not situational attributions.
- [x] Illusory correlation based on distinctiveness
    > Overweighting a distinctive negative case creates an illusory link between the group and crime.
- [ ] Accurate statistical reasoning
    > Drawing a broad conclusion from one case is statistically inaccurate.
- [ ] Self-perception effects
    > The bias is about group-event pairing, not inferring one's own attitudes from behaviour.
```

```mcq
---
type: single
question: 30\. Overall, the workshop message on prejudice and stereotyping is that...
---

- [ ] Biases are fixed traits and cannot be mitigated
    > The session stressed that biases can be addressed.
- [x] Awareness, measurement limits, and representation all matter for reducing bias
    > Understanding biases, their measurement limits, and representation are key to reducing them.
- [ ] Media have no role in shaping stereotypes
    > Media influence was highlighted as significant.
- [ ] Only explicit attitudes matter for behaviour
    > Implicit as well as explicit attitudes affect behaviour.
