> **Discuss both these views** and give your own opinion. (C14T1)

Positive:

- Statement: Mental health leads to ultimate well-being.
- Reasoning: Happiness is the only sensible and motivational reason of human. Positive cognition intermediates wealth's effect on happiness.
- Example: Research conducted by UCL: correlation between fortune and happiness is not significant enough, even lower than geographical differences (Should use ANOVA actually)

Negative:

- Fight for people's right (social welfare)
- Statement: Not an individual issue but a systematic problem.
- Reasoning: The world has enough for everyone's need but not everyone's greed (cite: Gandhi). Workers should fight for their right and power in wealth allocations. Though enhancing the social welfare, people with difficulty at time could be helped.
- Example: South and North Korea.

- Example1: Chinese yummy fish was distinguished 50 years ago, leading a rapid duplication of zooplankton in Dongting Lake, which is the main habitat of it...blablabla
- Reasoning2: (Further) Human is taking part in this circle...
- Example2: Shark and whale are no longer enough for hunt -> of food shortage

Other Problems:

- ~~Statement: The history is happening (Hamilton? hah), and will be the trend in the future.~~
- Statement: Highly enhanced the accessibility of knowledge.
- Reasoning: Poor students, researchers who may have 
- Example: Poor region cannot afford newspaper and become barrier for research.

Negative (Consequence):

- Statement: But at what cost? 
- Reasoning1: Free content goes hand in hand bias because of sponsored advertisement. Employees need to bring home the bacon,  and enterprise need to make ends meet. -> Sponsorship -> avoid content harmful for sponsors.
- Example1: China Southern vs. Hong Kong daily which hand out in the tube for free.
- Reasoning2: Violate copyrights, people will have less interest in publications.
- Example2: Sci-Hub and z-library are banded for piracy.

While some **advocate** for stricter restrictions on crime reporting, others argue for **nuanced** regulations .== Overall, the restriction should be balanced by taking social and individual factors in assessment.

Though, reporting elaborated descriptions are leading negative social consequences. ==Criminal details are risky in provoking crimes== by providing feasible means and mentally inspirations of offensive behaviour. A study conducted by Dr. Timmers at the University of Edinburgh indicates that individuals who watched detailed-crime documentary (compared with who read a short report) had a significant higher malice level in follow-up measurement (1- week and 5-weeks intervals).

However, adding restrictions conflicts with the freedom of speech. Publishers should have their right to print and distribute and ==excessive== limitations in content is harm to the publishing industry. ==Press freedom, while sacrosanct in democratic societies, must be balanced against social responsibilities. There are still few authoritarian regions in the world, especially in parts of Asia, showing how extreme media control can suppress social development.==

Furthermore, accurate crime reporting enhances public awareness, enabling them to **adopt** appropriate preventions. In China, the government has investigated a series of public education programs in fraud offence, effectively reducing the incidence by revealing the detail of it. In which program, citizens are imparted with popular fraud strategy, template, and behaviour patterns. Empowered by the knowledge, people are more likely to notice the fraud crime at the first time.

Ultimately, comprehensive reports on media have positive impact of the society and individual in personal developmental, political, and security perspective.

Positive:

- Statement: Regulation system.
- Reasoning: requirement and legislation of differs from regions, which may leads to practical inconvenience.
- Reasoning: professionals trait: need high regulation and certification. Lawyer - Law -> doctor & engineer - local regulation
- Example: China-built building in India just fallen and report indicates regulation is not fully followed because the difference between Chinese one and India one are not noticed by engineers -> climate and geographical difference leads such subtle difference

Negative:

- Statement: Exchange knowledge and import latest technique.
- Reasoning: Study aboard is one of the most important way to bring latest idea back to motherland.
- ~~Example: Qing dynasty sent international student to America, bring back latest political idea.~~
- Example: Chinese doctor Luan Bian performed the first brain surgery in 19s with knowledge learnt from America and started the research in China, spreading intelligence in China (joking).

> To what extent do you **agree or disagree** with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

While scientifical advancement undeniably enhanced living standards and life quality, I do not agree that human should put the major objective of science on it.

Admittedly, science has improved people's life quality by providing evolutionary health care and maintain. Thanks to it, the average age of human has been increased to around 82 years old according to World Health Organization. More and more illness and painfulness are being removed from the world, people are no longer suffered as before. However, this is not the only perspective of science.

Protection of environment is beneficial for mankind in long-term. Scientific investment in **proactive** ecological intervention prolongs the corruption of the last and only homeland of human, and is a worthy trade. Spending every one dollar on eco-friendly research saves seven dollars in future remediation, claimed by the World Bank in 2023. Actually, scientist has been done plenty of works on it. For example, a pesticide called DDT was widely used in last century but has replaced by newer medicine due to its pollution problem.

On the other hand, the intrinsic value of the science is to reveal principles of the universe. Disregard of applied science, basic researches, which has no visible value at present, are constructing the backbone of human techniques. ==As National Science Foundation data shows, 75% of major 21st-century innovations trace their origins to curiosity-driven studies conducted decades prior. This demonstrates that while applied science improves humans life, basic research discovers new possibility of human future.==

Conclusively, scientific progress serves humanity not only in live quality, but also in other equal-important objectives.

>Some university students want to learn about other subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others believe it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for a qualification. **Discuss both these views** and give your own opinion.

Positive:

- Statement: Study effective and promote cross-subject application.
- Reasoning1: Interest is the best teacher (Chinese idiom?),
- Example1: Research study with interest is 50% faster than who don't.
- Reasoning2: Science and technology develops by hybrid: cross-subject discipline break the barrier and take advantage for different field.
- Example2: Few latest psychology research are heading to AI based psychometrics.

Negative:

- Statement: Diploma and certificate are qualified measurement for people, which is the key objective for school.
- Reasoning1: prove one is capable to perform professional function.
- Example1: Lawyer -> diploma+certification; Psycho-Therapist -> master in Psychology ...
- Reasoning2: Helps people stand out in competition.
- Example2: General requirement for most giant companies are master degree in china.

Opinion:

- depends on career approach.

## **Cambridge 19**

>Some people think that competition at work, at school and in daily life is a good thing. Others believe that we should try to cooperate more, rather than competing against each other.
>**Discuss both these views** and give your own opinion.

Positive:

- Statement: Motivate progress.
- Reasoning1: Human nature and interest driven.
- Example1: KPI -> overall high performance/Chinese education 
- Reasoning2: Better commodity in the market.
- Example2: Phone market -> new technology -> benefits customer

Negative:

- Statement: Giant ambitious needs group of people. 
- Reasoning1: Human cannot be expert in every single field -> help each other.
- Example1: Function and department in group and enterprise.
- Reasoning2: Judging the succession solely on the result of competition leads to unethical conduct.
- Example2: Plagiarism problem + data.

Opinion:

- should make the objective clear - make them as tool but not goal and just play the game.

> The working week should be shorter and workers **should** have a longer weekend. Do you **agree or disagree**?

The working days should be shorter so that the weekend can be longer. I firmly agree with that because it is feasible and  beneficial.

Shorten the working time is overall elevating the efficiency of a business by broaden sources of income and reduce expenditure. Less more office time can save administrative costs such as electricity, water, and commute. For example, change a 5-days working scheme to a 4-days scheme is saving the overall cost by 20%. As for increasing the profit, researchers from the university of Manchester claim that the business income will rise 4.5% through increasing staff welfare by 10%. Some companies in north Europe are already applied a 4-days working schedule. In Singapore, the government even demand employers to provide flexible working options to their employee, including 4-days working scheme.

Longer weekend is a key to the growth of the tertiary industrial and  the economic. Long working time is torturing people by exhausting their psychological energy, depressing their need in entertainments. With more personal time, the population will have higher intention in self-cares and pleasures. With which need enhancement, the market should stimulate rapid expansion in leisure, tourism, and wellness industries. Cinemas, restaurants, and gyms witness 18-25% revenue surges during extended weekends according to Singapore Tourism Board statistics. This consumption-driven economic cycle ultimately increases tax revenues and creates 1.3 million service sector jobs annually in Asia-Pacific regions, as reported by International Labour Organization.

In conclusion, shorter working days with longer weekend is practicable and is what it should be.
