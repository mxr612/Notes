## 3. Like and Dislikes
### skill learning

**Do you engage in playing video games regularly?**

To tell the truth, I have been played video games biweekly for over 10 years. For me, playing video games with a proper interval can not only entertain myself but also closer the relationship with friends. 

**Do you have an interest in science?**

Of course, I have been studied science since my primary school. For me, science is not only the way I exercise my brain, but also a philosophy  understanding truth.

**How often do you use a calculator?**

Honestly, I started to use a calculator only since my collage time. And now I am highly relied on it, on daily basis. For me, it’s not only a tool which accurate my work, but a good time saver that allows me to have more free time.

### pros and cons

-   **Do you like your name? Why or why not?**

    Absolutely, having this name is quite inspiring my through out my life. Shangxuan means advocate or striving to become a backbone of something, which is quite aline with my aspiration. Although it’s quite difficult to explain to or memorized by others, I still believe that it can bring me more benefits than drawbacks.

-   **Do you enjoy spending time in crowded places?**

    I’m afraid my answer will be negative. Although it is inevitable to be in busy area following some specific purpose, like attending live show or enjoy hard drinks in pub, my personal orientation is not extravert enough in engaging massive social activities.

-   **Do you frequently wear sunglasses?**

    Sure, wearing sunglasses has unquestionable benefits. For instance, protecting your eyes under intense ultraviolet and hiding your eye activities in complicated scene. Although some may say it is impolite to wear sunglasses in most cases, I believe it’s more helpful than harmful.

### multiple choice

-   **Do you prefer colder or warmer weather? Why?**

    Speaking of the weather I’m into most, I guess the award goes to a hot sunny day. The reason behand this is that a higher temperature is more activating me into daily works while cold weather just frustrating me once I go out.

-   **Do  you  pay  more  attention  to  the  design,  functionality,  or  brand  of  the watch?**

    When it comes to the most important trait of a watch, it should be it’s design. Although some may be lack of the discipline about design and know only about famous brands, I believe it’s more important to fit the watch into my outfit. As for the functionality, there are no use that a smart phone is not capable at present. Therefore, I’m paying more attention to the design.

-   **Do you prefer to make detailed plans or just have a general idea?**

    In terms of project managements, I am more the type of rough scheduler. I guess the main reason behind it is that no one can fully predict the future source, market, or whatever status. So why don’t just make a brief structure and enrich it when more detail are confirmed.

### personal experience

-   **What’s the most interesting geographical feature you’ve seen?** 

    Regarding the most splendid scene I have ever seen, it is definitely the valley in east-west China. I still remember it was my 15 when my father brought me to the spot where only opens in winter due to the water line restriction. There were 90 degree cliffs beside a deep river and people are walking on the path with only one shoulder width.

-   **Have you ever grown ﬂowers by yourself?**

    To be honest, growing flowers is not my cup of tea. I’ve tried for many times with every single skill or tool. It only turns out that none of my flowers can live over a week. Maybe I would better just enjoy flowers in others’ parterre.

-   **Did you have a penchant for eating cakes during your childhood?**

    To be frank, I was in some degree of obesity during when I was a child, which is just because I took too many cakes. If my memory serves me well, I once ate my whole birthday cake before my birthday, leading no cake in the party at last. 

### 5W

-   **What activities do you engage in when you stay at home?**

    Let’s say, I read books or watch movies in the most occurrence. I am found with laying in my sofa with my lovely cat, served with a cup of coffee in a cosy afternoon. 

-   **What types of assistance do you usually ask for?**

    I don’t usually ask for a hand unless it is necessary. If I have to say, it mostly because I am lack of some resources that others may have. For example, I may ask my friend who have a printer to print my paper, or ask my neighbour to drive me to the downtown.

-   **How frequently do you go online?**

    I’m more or less a old-fashioned person who seldom scroll short videos and news online. What do I only do online is updating my blog, like once a week. It usually takes me around 3 hours to transfer my writings and photos online with fine typeset with my friend’s help.

## 5. Personal Preference

**Do you usually relax or keep yourself busy during the evening?** （补一个 Usually=Typical 问题）

It depends on my workload. **Nine times out of ten**, I prefer to wind down myself by reading a book or watching a series after a long day. But **when push comes to shove**, I'll **burn the midnight oil** for deadlines.

**Do you prefer to study alone or with a group?**

I'm **a lone wolf** when studying - it lets me **march to the beat of my own drum**. The main reason behind it is that studying alone allows me to focus on my own pace. However, from time to time, I do enjoy participating in group study to brainstorm ideas and get different perspectives.

**Do you prefer living in a house or an apartment?**

A house wins **hands down**. Because a house usually offers more space and privacy, which not only makes me more comfortable, but also allows me to enjoy the backyard. In contrary, apartments tends to be more crowd and noisy.

**Do you prefer to make detailed plans or just have a general idea?**

Frankly speaking, planning the detail is more my cup of tea, instead of just having a general idea. Elaborated structure of procedure allows me to stay organized and empower me in complicated tasks, and avoid unexpected problems.

**Do you prefer sending text messages or making phone calls?**

Sending text messages is always my first priority compared with making phone calls. The flexibility in interaction time is a huge convenient, making it possible to leave a message anytime I want, even in midnight when others are sleeping.

**Do you prefer e-books or paper books?**

Personally speaking, I'm quite into e-books rather than paper books. The chief reason is that e-books can not only save physical space, but also allow me to adjust font size for comfortable reading. While paper books, though providing tactile pleasure, are less convenient to carry around.

**Do you prefer colder or warmer weather? Why?**

Personally speaking, cooler weather is way better than hot weather for me. The chief reason is that there are a lot of winter sports are only in cool climate. Or even, just enjoy a hot drink in winter is also good for me.

**Do you like T-shirts with pictures on them?**

As for me, T-shirts without patterns lose their meaning—like a man without a name. You should have something that distinguishes you from others beyond just the colour. Personally, I like cartoons like snoopy.

**Do you prefer shopping at big stores or small local shops? Why?**

Big stores are always my priority for its stability in quality, while small ones may vary from day to day. Big shops also have a wider variety and competitive price, which saves my time and money.

**Do you prefer modern art or traditional art?**

It depends on the context. Modern art fascinates me for its abstract ideas, while traditional art feels timeless. If forced to choose, I’d lean toward modern art for its innovation.

**Do you prefer learning alone or with others?**

I'm more into learning alone than in a couple or group. Individual study makes me focus and better my productivity. However, I would try group work from time to time if the workload is overwhelming.

**Do you prefer studying at home or in other locations?**

If it's possible, I would like to study in a café of library rather than at home. Which habit allows me to dive into work quickly, with higher productivity.

**Do you prefer planned travel itineraries?**

Absolutely, confirmed plan relieves the stress while  what up in the air inspires curiosity. As for me, I'm more the former one because I'm suffering from anxiety.  

**Do you prefer to plan your weekend activities in advance?**

I'd rather **go with the flow** without any expectation. It just like nurturing a plant or kitty —— you don't have to take care for every step, everything will just work fine.

**Which do you use more often, a pen or a pencil?**
**Do you usually use a pen or pencil?**

Nine times of ten, **you'll catch me putting** a pen to paper, but not a pencil. Pen is more reliable than pencil and capable from signatures to diaries. On the other hand, pencils are only suitable for draft which needs frequent erasing.

**Do you usually choose hats based on fashion trends or for practical purposes like sun protection?**

I'm not one to **follow the herd** with trendy hats, sun protection **takes the cake**. A wide-brimmed hat **weights more than gold** in summer in order to protect me from the UV.

## 6. Comparison

### 6.1 Object Comparison

**How does your school differ from others? (School Change/Schools)**

It seems that there's **a world of difference** between my school and others. One major **distinction** is the emphasis of humanity development. What I mean by humanity development is that students are caring more about human in the society, unlike other schools are striving solely on course grades. That's what **set my school apart**, the humanity spirit.

**What are the differences between shopping in a shopping mall and in a street market? (买便宜货的人)**

Personally speaking, they're like **chalk and cheese**, which mainly because the price and quality. Shopping in malls seems more possible to meet qualified and branded products, but they **cost you an arm and a leg**. However, stores on street are **bustling with** bargains and local flavours. To summarize, these factors deeply distinguished a mall and a street market.

**What are the differences between intelligence and knowledge? (聪明的人)**

Back to the definition, they are highly different concepts. Intelligence refers to the capability to think, calculate, and solve problems, while knowledge is accumulated information. One key example is that acquiring knowledge do not generate new knowledge, and thinking without knowledge neither. But using intelligence to think over the knowledge may do. Therefore, these are two totally different concepts which usually work together. 

**What are the differences between quiet places in the city and those in the countryside? (安静的地方)**

As a student, the major difference for me should be the disruption. Urban quiet spot, like a café, are designed to be quiet, which means it is not originally be quiet. Therefore, one may be afraid of disruption during focus time. On the other hand, rural places are born to be quiet without disruption, allowing people stay focus without concern. In one word, countryside is more suitable for who want to dive into something while quiet places in city can be a short-time shelter for disruption.

**What are the differences between the things adults learn and the things that children learn? (向他人展示)**

In my eyes, what sets something apart things for adults and children are the objective the utility. Adults are acquiring knowledges in order to bring home the bacon which are more pragmatic. For children, it's more important to **march to their own drum** following their interest. Based on what I said above, I guess this is one of the major differences between things adults learn and what children learn.

### 6.2 Time Comparison

**How has your mobile phone changed your life? (Mobile Phone)**

As a **gen-z**, I really cannot draw a clear distinction between life with and without mobile phone, to my best of my knowledge. For me, it's an all-in-one toolbox for communication, note-taking, calendar and so on. **Back to the age** when mobile phone hadn't been invented, I guess people need to do these by different objects, like a notebook or a real calendar. To summarize, the convenience should be the major difference the mobile phone changed my life. 

**Are there more recreational activities available for young people now compared to 20 years ago? (儿时休闲活动)**

There should be a world of difference between what today's children and 20 years ago play. Options to day are **off the charts**, mobile games, video games, or vintages if you want. Kids once played **come rain or shine**, while now they're **bursting to** unlock digital achievements. So there should be more entertainments now than 20 years ago.

**How do you think inventions have significantly changed people's lifestyles over the years? (有用的日常发明)**

There are a plenty of new stuff that changed our life. For example, the smartphone. People used to spend time on chores like sending mails and marking dates and render events.
Mobile phone can knock them down at once now, saving time for higher production or recreational time. To **put it in a nutshell**, inventions have truly **turned our lives upside down**.

**How do you think the future of cash usage will be in an increasingly digital economy? (Money)**

Everyone can see how digital payments by far dominate, though there are still privacy concerns. Overall, the cash will **kick the bucket** due to its inconvenience. The shift is still **in the air**, but I guess it's **around the corner**.

**How has the way of celebrating events changed in recent years? (庆祝的重要事件)**

To the best of my knowledge, the way people celebrate significant events has really **had a facelift** in recent years. In the past, it was a treasurable time for families who gather together. Nowadays, people tend to go out for some activities, like parties or celebrations. All in all, the bottom line is that celebrations have become more entertaining.

## 7. Future Plan

### Part 1

**Describe the type of house or apartment you envision living in the future.**

To own a flat with breathtaking view has been my dream since childhood. Ideally, it would be somewhere **high up**, so the ==entire city is spread out before my eyes==. Of course, modern facilities are a must. Spending an afternoon in a sunny balcony can **wind me down** after a busy week.

**Would you like to start your own small business in the future?**

That's my aspiration, and I have been **bursting to start** something entrepreneurial. Having my own business is far better than working for others. You could have a flexible arrangement, no mater for your day or your holiday schedule. Also, you may take back control of what you are doing, where your project is heading to, and how you, or maybe with your partner, achieve your value through the business.

**Do you have any plans or aspirations for the next five years?**

My key word will be academic in upcoming five years. I **am about to start** my year 1 of BSS ~~in~~ this fall, and planning to pursue a master's degree for two years after my undergraduate studies. It means a lot to me, though there are problems financially and academically. I believe that I can overcome them and achieve my ambitions.

**Would you contemplate altering your morning routine in the future?**

If it's possible, I would like to add some morning reading before I technically start my day. It helps me stay updated with the world's latest news and knowledges. At present, I am pushed by deadlines, leading no volition in my self staffs like my interest or even basic well-being. It sounds like a bit out of control, thus I don't like it.

**Which languages would you like to learn in the future?**

To tell a truth, learning language is not **my strong suit**. ==Being multilingual would open doors and **give me an edge** in today's globalized world, but it's **easier said than done**.== While I have been bursting to learn Japanese, I always seem to **get cold feet** halfway through. ==**The bottom line is**, mastering a language requires qualities I wasn't born with: a sharp memory and consistent practice.==

### Part 2 (Longer answers about future plans)

**Describe something you would like to learn in the future.**

I have been dreaming for riding a motorcycle for a while, but right now I’m up to my ears in work and other commitments. Months later, It will be easier for me and I guess that will be a nice time for me to start practicing motorcycle. If it comes true, I could drive stylish motor for my commute, or even have a motor-trip, which should be absolutely cool. 

**Describe a foreign country you would like to visit in the future.**

==If I could pack my bags and travel anywhere, Russia would be at the **top of my bucket list**.==^[Your bucket list consists of all the things you would really like to do or see in your life.] I’ve always been fascinated by its vast landscapes and rich history. **What really takes the cake** for me is the idea of taking the Trans-Siberian Railway from Beijing to Moscow. I could ever imagine myself gazing out the window, watching the scenery of endless forests and snowy plains.

**Describe an ambition that you haven't achieved (includes: How you plan to achieve it).**

I am dying to start my own business, but yet not successful. I have a project providing psychological content rendered by generative AI, which provides user with professional measurement and results **easy to grasp**. ==This idea has been on my mind for quite a while, but I haven’t managed to **bring it to life yet**.== By the end of this year, I will polish the free version of it, and next year I will start to develop some advanced functions. I believe that with my engagement, my ambition will soon become true .

## 8. Personal Experience


### Part 1 (Personal Experience Focus)

**Have you ever had the experience of fishing?**

If my memory serves me well, my parent had taken me to a pay-to-fish pond when I was like 14 or 16. At the time, I know nothing about fishing but using a stick and a wire. My dad taught me about all the required skills. I spent hours waiting **for a bite** but end up empty-handed. I guess the most required skill or quality for fishing should be your patient.

**Have you ever forgotten something important?**

Absolutely, I guess everyone got such experience. For me, I always forgot friends' birthday, even my ex-girlfriend. I guess that's the reason we broke up, but I got no evident. She thought I should have prepared a huge surprise for her at the time and started guessing what was it. But the truth is, I only noticed that when she was asking.

**Have you made any new friends recently?**

Luckily yes, I was striving to scroll tinder since I was new to this city. I had matched with few girls at the moment, but the first time when I met her offline I was like **heals over head**. We talked about film, literature, and philosophy. She is a student major in film producing in a college near my place. We are going hand in hand now, studying together for language tests and planing for further studies.

**Have you ever made a good decision recently?**

The first thing comes to my mind is the psychological consulting. I am a psychology student, but I have never tried it. Recently, I am totally in chaos from life to work and study. I even have frictions with my family for my study plan. My consultant saved me a lot, from the overwhelming emotion and endless works.

**Have you ever taken a risk that ended up with a positive result?**

Generally speaking, I am not a person who takes risk, but in order to achieve my ambition, I have to. I didn't do well in the university entrance test in my country, and facing two choices that rather enter a notorious school or have a shot for associate degree in Hong Kong. An associate degree is not accepted in China as a formal degree, but making it easier to apply for a better college in the Education system of UK. I took my shot, and it comes up to be my GPA is good enough to enter top-tier universities in the world, and even awarded with scholarship in Hong Kong.

**Describe a time when you made a plan to do an activity with a lot of people.**

Schedule events are inevitable for school clubs, and plays an important role in leadership education. Once I was assigned to design a booth for well-being week in my college, on behalf of Psychology health association. It was my first time leading a large-scale event, and I’ll admit I **got cold feet** initially—coordinating 20 volunteers and expecting 200+ visitors felt like **biting off more than I could chew**. But in the end everything goes well, students enjoys our booth, and I learned that how a man can be creative under a high pressure.

## 9. Personal perspective
### Part 1

**Do you think teachers play an important role in students' lives?**

I would use the word, essential. Students' mental, physical, and intellectual development are highly influenced by their educator. What I mean by that is, understanding and intervention are two key functions  teachers perform and will eventually change children's life upside down.

**Do you think teamwork can improve work efficiency?**

No, absolutely no. From my experience, group works only lead to social loafing. Social loafing is a psychological concept indicating that people are more tends to work less hard when in a big group, which is verified by bunches of repetition experiences. Personally speaking, working by my self is a far better option. You are able to march to the beat of your own drum.

**Do you think taking photos can help you remember things?**

There's no doubt that photos are useful cue to fetch back memories. Memories are networks built with neural cells. Which means, people lose their words or details of something, are simply because the lack of some entrance. Visual sources are vivid start points that brings you back to the time.  

**Do you think it's important to have free time?**

I do enjoy spare time that I don't have to be stressed by all sorts of things. Recently I was busy in test preparation. If things gets better, I would like to have a long holiday. The reason behind the benefit of being free is to enjoy the peace of life, which is mentally halpful.

**Do you think it's easy to make true friends?**

In my view, being true is not easy for everyone, never say having a true friend that you can stay real to each other. You have to know the person well, including what they do even what they think. All these are based on you two have common interest, adjacent geographically and other limitations. 

### Part 3


**In your opinion, what makes a story engaging and worth sharing in daily life?**

I guess it depends on your audience. For kids, maybe an interesting story with prince and princess is good enough. But for adults, things are totally different. We are looking for emotional relatability, well-paced narrative, and even advanced techniques like literature devices if you're a literature student.

**In your opinion, what are the most common causes of disagreements between people?**

People from all walks of life, has its circle of life. Adding with their culture and religion background, it becomes harder to stay in the same page. To cope with such difficulty, people should distinguish the “fact” and the “opinion” at first, which is also the common root why people are disagreeing with each other.

> Tips: Cognitive, social, and situational factors

**In your opinion, what are the key benefits of effective time management for individuals and society as a whole?**

Just like machine needs to reduce energy waste, systems big as society or small as one person needs to save their time. It says that, time is invaluable, but I believe that it could be valued as the cost of maintenance. For example, my living cost per day is $50 in average, therefore spending one day doing nothing will be a waste of $50. These time waste is happening everywhere, increasing the cost of both individual and society. 

> Productivity & Efficiency, Economic & Environmental 

**In your opinion, what should technology developers do to improve the user experience and make their products more accessible?**

It's a hard one. First things first, they need a comprehensive research of the market, especially their target market. Based on which, business can tailor their product to meet user needs and preference. Specifically, people always complain that taxi takes forever to arrive, which may be a good point to start a better user experience.

**In your opinion, what are some effective teaching methods that can enhance students’ learning experience?**

I would say one of the effective method is hands-on learning. Nowadays, teachers are more tends to assign homework that allows students to find solutions online by them self in order to solve a given problem. In which progress, students are more engaged in understanding the reason choosing the specific orientation in such circumstance, instead of just listening to lectueror and memorize rules.

## 10. The public

### Part 1

**Why do you think chocolate is popular worldwide?**

Aww, who don't like chocolate! It's an ultimate comfort food. You can eat it on your own or share with your friends. Also, you can just simply eat it or make it into different delicious foods like ice cream, cakes, and cookies.

**What are the most and least popular apps in China?**

It depends on what ages you are talking about. For younger generations, the red note is highly used, especially by girls because there are latest sharing for fashion, food, and so on. For elderly, maybe news apps like RSS subscriptions are the most popular one. But when it comes to the least used one, it should belong to apps that the government ask you to install, like the anti-fraud apps.

**Do you think most people in China can effectively balance their work and personal life?**

Work-life balance is a universal problem. From what I've seen, a lot of people in China are really dedicated to their work and are willing to put their extra effort to get ahead. They have a bunch of debts to pay including houses, cars, and nurturing kids. They have to bring home the bacon and make ends meet.

**How do public events contribute to community engagement?**

Well, public activities bring people together. It's a chance for people to mingle, share experience, and exchange opinions. For example, a local festival engages all walks of life, allowing them to have fun and feel a sense of belonging to what bigger than them self.

**What activities can people do in parks and gardens?**

People may kill their time and enjoy the outdoors in green lands of the city. I always find someone is playing tai-chi in the park near my place in the morning. Parents also walks their kids after their school to let them burn out energies a bit. Overall, it's a good place for outdoors, not only for exercises, but also could be reading and picnics.

### Part 3 (from Part 2 topics)

**What negative effects can noise have on people's lives and health?**

Noise is quite annoying for most of the time. It may bother you when you are working, having bad impact in people's mood and mental health. If you stay in an environment with high level of noise, it could also influence your acoustic function. So it's a must to put on ear plugs when you are going to work or stay in a noisy place. 

**Are there differences in the types of noise people tolerate in different environments (such as at home, at work, or in entertainment venues)? Why?**

It depends on what type of task you are expecting to accomplish in the place. At home, people are more tending to let their hair down, so they may expect a quieter environment. But when you are working in your office, you may have tolerant to sound like typing or discussing because it's inevitable in work place. When you are going out for some fun, you may even seek noise to let off some steam.

**What kind of culture is popular among the young?**

There are different type of sub-culture nowadays. Young people are being fans of K-pop of J-pop depends on which type of idol they prefer. Also, social media influencer are producing cultures based on their opinion and knowledge frame, which is spreading though out the young like a fever.

**Will people use bikes more or less in cities in the future?**

That's a tough one. Some say modern transportations are taking place of walking and cycling gradually, but ultimately it's impossible. The use of bicycle will be limited but common in the future in my view. In order to access public transports, you may need a bike to get to a bus or tube station, which may maintain the use of bike.

**Do you think people are more easily persuaded by those they know well or by strangers? Why?**

It depends on the situation, like what is the topic you are talking about. People may more easily be persuaded by acquaintance because of the trust. However, they may also be stubborn due to the stereotype, which may not likely happen on strangers. So for topics people don't like to think too much, they may just pick friends' brain. For topics that they need to contemplate, maybe strangers will provide a totally different perspective and persuade successfully.
