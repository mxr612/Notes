### Idiom

[Idioms99](../../note.mxr612.io/IELTS/Idioms99.md)

**Q: How do you usually study for exams?**
I usually hit the books for several hours each day. Sometimes, when the material is tough, I really have to put on my thinking cap and brainstorm ideas with classmates. I try to avoid burning the midnight oil too much, though, to stay healthy.

**Q: What’s the most important thing about family?**
I believe blood is thicker than water, meaning family relationships are the strongest. Even if there are conflicts, it’s important to bury the hatchet and keep supporting each other. In my experience, my family is truly the apple of my eye.

**Q: Do you enjoy cooking?**
Yes, I find cooking to be a piece of cake once you learn the basics. I like trying new recipes, though sometimes I end up in a pickle if I forget an ingredient! Also, I never spill the beans when it comes to secret family recipes.

**Q: How do you manage your finances?**
I know money doesn’t grow on trees, so I try to tighten my belt and avoid spending unnecessarily. It’s important to build a nest egg for emergencies. Sometimes, though, I have to make ends meet on a tight budget.

**Q: How would you describe your personality?**
I usually try to go with the flow and stay positive. I like to put my best foot forward when meeting new people, though sometimes I get cold feet in stressful situations. Overall, I try not to have a chip on my shoulder about past mistakes.

- To express lack of consideration, use:
    - _"It didn’t cross my mind"_ (from [Idioms99](obsidian://open?file=2025_IELTS%2FSpeaking%2FIdioms99.md)).
    - _"I didn’t give it much thought"_ (neutral).
    - _"It slipped my mind"_ (for forgetting).
